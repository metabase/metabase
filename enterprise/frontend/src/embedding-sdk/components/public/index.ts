// These functions looks useless but it's a trick to have a way to type the config
// while having code snippets the same across js and ts. This works because the
// type is only in the function declaration and not where the config is
// declared. `const config = defineEmbeddingSdkConfig({})` will have the type of
// `SDKConfig` and even provide autocompletion for js users depending on their
// IDE configuration.
