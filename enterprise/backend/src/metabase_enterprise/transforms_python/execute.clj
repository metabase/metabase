  Python transforms produce output while they run. The message log is a stateful structure that buffers log outputs during the run.
  The goal is to assist in debugging in the case of python runtime or syntax errors, and to provide some immediate feedback for longer running transforms.

  Important Note: in memory buffering is considered acceptable as we expect /logs output to be truncated or small.

  The intended use of this structure is to produce a string suitable for `transform_run.message`, saving it every few seconds."
