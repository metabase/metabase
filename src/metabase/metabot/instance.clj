(ns metabase.metabot.instance
  "Logic for deciding which Metabase instance in a multi-instance (i.e., horizontally scaled) setup gets to be the
  MetaBot.

  Close your eyes, and imagine a scenario: someone is running multiple Metabase instances in a horizontal cluster.
  Good for them, but how do we make sure one, and only one, of those instances, replies to incoming MetaBot commands?
  It would certainly be too much if someone ran, say, 4 instances, and typing `metabot kanye` into Slack gave them 4
  Kanye West quotes, wouldn't it?

  Luckily, we have an \"elegant\" solution: we'll use the Settings framework to keep track of which instance is
  currently serving as the MetaBot. We'll have that instance periodically check in; if it doesn't check in for some
  timeout interval, we'll consider the job of MetaBot up for grabs. Each instance will periodically check if the
  MetaBot job is open, and, if so, whoever discovers it first will take it.

  How do we uniquiely identify each instance?

  `metabase.public-settings/local-process-uuid` is randomly-generated upon launch and used to identify this specific
  Metabase instance during this specifc run. Restarting the server will change this UUID, and each server in a
  hortizontal cluster will have its own ID, making this different from the `site-uuid` Setting. The local process UUID
  is used to differentiate different horizontally clustered MB instances so we can determine which of them will handle
  MetaBot duties."
