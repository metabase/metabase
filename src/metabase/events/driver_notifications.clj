  "Driver notifications are used to let drivers know database details or other relevant information has
  changed (`:database-update`) or that a Database has been deleted (`:database-delete`). Drivers can choose to be
  notified of these events by implementing the `metabase.driver/notify-database-updated` multimethod. At the time of
  this writing, the SQL JDBC driver 'superclass' is the only thing that implements this method, and does so to close
  connection pools when database details change or when they are deleted."
