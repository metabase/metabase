  So this turns your average 10, 20, 30 character query into a 110, 120, 130 etc character query.
  One leaky-abstraction part of this is that this will confuse the bejeezus out of
  people who first encounter their passed-through RDBMS error messages.

  'Hey, this is a 20 character query! What's it talking about, error at position 120?'
