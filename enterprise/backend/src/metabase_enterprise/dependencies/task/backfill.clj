(ns metabase-enterprise.dependencies.task.backfill
  "Implements a task that brings all entities with dependencies tracked in the dependency table
  (see [[metabase-enterprise.dependencies.models.dependency]]) up to date, that is, makes sure
  the dependency table contains fresh entries.

  This is done by finding entities whose dependency_analysis_version is less than
  [[metabase-enterprise.dependencies.models.dependency/current-dependency-analysis-version]] and
  updates this field. In most cases this triggers an event handler that calculates the dependencies
  and populates the dependency table. For cards, the event is emitted by the job handler itself,
  because the update of the record doesn't trigger the event handler. "
