(defmacro def-reversible-migration
  "Define a reversible custom migration. Both the forward and reverse migrations are defined using the same structure,
  similar to the bodies of multi-arity Clojure functions.

  The first thing in each migration body must be a one-element vector containing a binding to use for the database
  object provided by Liquibase, so that migrations have access to it if needed. This should typically not be used
  directly, however, because is also set automatically as the current connection for Toucan 2.

  Example:

  ```clj
  (def-reversible-migration ExampleMigrationName
   ([_database]
    (migration-body))

   ([_database]
    (migration-body)))"
  [name [[db-binding-1] & migration-body] [[db-binding-2] reverse-migration-body]]
