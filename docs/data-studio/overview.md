# Data Studio Overview

To get into Data Studio, click the cog wheel in the top right, and select _Data Studio_ from the dropdown menu. Data Studio is only available to administrators at this point.

## What's in Data Studio

- **[Library](./library.md)**: A curated space for your organization's most trusted analytics content—tables, metrics, and SQL snippets that your data team recommends.
- **[Dependency graph](./dependency-graph.md)**: A visual map of how your content connects, so you can understand the impact of changes before you make them.
- **[Dependency diagnostics](./dependency-diagnostics.md)**: Find broken dependencies and unused items, so you can fix problems and clean up safely.
