(ns metabase.events
  "Provides a very simply event bus using `core.async` to allow publishing and subscribing to interesting topics
  happening throughout the Metabase system in a decoupled way.

  ## Regarding Events Initialization:

  The most appropriate way to initialize event listeners in any `metabase.events.*` namespace is to implement the
  `events-init` function which accepts zero arguments. This function is dynamically resolved and called exactly once
  when the application goes through normal startup procedures. Inside this function you can do any work needed and add
  your events subscribers to the bus as usual via `start-event-listener!`."
