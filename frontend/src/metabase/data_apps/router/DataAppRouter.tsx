 * on the `<DataAppLink>` component. All routing state lives on the
 * `browserHistory` singleton (from `react-router`, but used only for its
 * function-based `push` / `listen` API — no React components, no legacy
 * context).
 *
 * `<DataAppRouter>` itself is a pass-through today. It stays as a
 * dedicated component so future additions (error boundaries, suspense,
 * routing-scoped providers) can land here without a breaking change to
 * the bundle's `<DataAppRouter>` usage.
