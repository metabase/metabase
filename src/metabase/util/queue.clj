(ns metabase.util.queue
  "Functionality for working with queues.
   There are two main blocks of functionality: a custom BoundedTransferQueue and a queue listener.

  The BoundedTransferQueue allows for callers to decide whether to block the previous synchronous put to complete
  before adding another message, or attempt to add it to a fixed-sized async queue if there is space.
  See `bounded-transfer-queue` for more details.

  The queue listener allows the creation and management of (possibly) multithreaded queue listeners that can
  process messages off the queue in batches.
  Listeners should generally be managed with `init-listener! which calls `listen!`.
