# Driver Interface Changelog

Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

Below is a list of changes to our driver interface for driver authors in each major version of Metabase.

Generally, when we deprecate things, we'll list them here and wait three major versions before removing them entirely.

## What's new for driver authors in Metabase 0.42.0

Changes in Metabase 0.42.0 almost exclusively only affect drivers that derive from `:sql` (including `:sql-jdbc`).
Non-SQL drivers likely will require no changes.

0.42.0 introduces several significant changes to the way the SQL query processor compiles and determines aliases for
MBQL `:field` clauses. For more background, see pull request
[#19384](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/19384).

For the most part, SQL drivers don't need to make any changes unless they were doing manipulating Field or Table
aliases. For drivers that were doing these things, lots of overlapping vars and methods have been consolidated, which
means the bulk of the changes you'll need to make is simply deleting deprecated method implementations.

#### Significant changes

- The `metabase.driver.sql.query-processor/->honeysql` method for Field instances, e.g.

  ```clj
  (defmethod sql.qp/->honeysql [:my-driver (class Field)]
    [driver field]
    ...)
  ```

  is no longer invoked. All compilation is now handled by the MBQL `:field` clause method, e.g.

  ```clj
  (defmethod sql.qp/->honeysql [:my-driver :field]
    [driver field-clause]
    ...)
  ```

  If you were doing something special here, you'll need to move that special login into `[<driver> :field]` instead.
  (You may no longer need this special logic, however -- see below.)

- `:field`, `:expression`, and `:aggregation-options` clauses now contain information about what aliases you should
  use to refer to them on both the left-hand side and right-hand side of SQL `AS` or elsewhere in a query. See PR
  [#19610](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/19610) for a detailed discussion about the new information,
  hereafter referred to as the /[#19610 information](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/19610)/.

- `->honeysql` methods, specifically implementations for `:field`, should use or replace the
  [#19610 information](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/19610) rather than attempting to determine or
  override it in some other fashion. If your driver does not have a custom implementation of `->honeysql` for `:field`
  or `(class Field)`, you don't need to worry about this.

#### New methods

- `metabase.driver/escape-alias` (moved from `metabase.driver.sql.query-processor/escape-alias`, which was introduced
  in 0.41.0) is now used to generate the [#19610 information](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/19610) and
  used consistently across the SQL QP code. If you need to transform generated Field aliases for any reason (such as
  escaping disallowed characters), implement this method.

#### Deprecated methods and vars

The following methods and vars are slated for removal in Metabase 0.45.0 unless otherwise noted.

- `metabase.driver/format-custom-field-name` is now unused. Implement `metabase.driver/escape-alias` instead.

- `metabase.driver.sql.query-processor/escape-alias` has been renamed to `metabase.driver/escape-alias`. Everything
  else is the same. Implementations of the old method will continue to work for now, but please update your drivers to
  implement the new method since it will be removed in a future release.

- `metabase.driver.sql.query-processor/field-clause->alias` no longer uses the optional parameter `unique-name-fn`.
  Aliases are now made unique automatically, after escaping them; implement `metabase.driver/escape-alias` if you need
  to do something special before they are made unique. (Unique aliases are also escaped a second time if you need to
  do something /really/ special.)

- `metabase.driver.sql.query-processor/field->alias`, which was deprecated in 0.41.0, is now unused in 0.42.0.
  Implementing this method no longer has any effect. Implement `metabase.driver/escape-alias` instead if you need to
  do something special; use the [#19610 information](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/19610) if you the alias
  for one reason or another. This method is still slated for removal in Metabase 0.44.0.

- `metabase.driver.sql.query-processor/*field-options*` is now unused and is no longer bound automatically. Create
  your own version if you need it for some reason. See our SQL Server driver for an example.

- `metabase.driver.sql.query-processor/*table-alias*` is now unused and is no longer bound automatically. Use or
  override `:metabase.query-processor.util.add-alias-info/source-table` from the [#19610
  information](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/19610) instead.

- `metabase.driver.sql.query-processor/*source-query*` is now unused and is no longer bound automatically. Use
  `metabase.driver.sql.query-processor/*inner-query*` instead, which is always bound even if we are not inside of a
  source query.

- `metabase.driver.sql.query-processor/field->identifier` is now unused. Implementing this method should no longer be
  necessary under any circumstances. Override `->honeysql` for `[<driver> :field]` and manipulate the [#19610
  information](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/19610) if you need to do something special here.

- `metabase.driver.sql.query-processor/prefix-field-alias` is no longer used. Previously, it was made available to
  give drivers a change to escape automatically generated aliases for joined Fields. This is no longer necessary,
  because `metabase.driver/escape-alias` is called on automatically generated aliases. Implement
  `metabase.driver/escape-alias` if you need to do something special.

#### Removed Methods and Vars

- `metabase.mbql.schema/DatetimeFieldUnit`, deprecated in 0.39.0, is now removed.
