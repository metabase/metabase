# Metabase Writing Style Guide

## Core Principles

Write like you're talking to a colleague. Be conversational, not formal. Get people what they need quickly. Know your audience and match the complexity.

## Tone and Voice

**Do:**

- Use contractions ("can't" not "cannot")
- Say "people" or "companies" instead of "users"
- Be friendly but not peppy
- Acknowledge limitations honestly ("that's on us, not them")
- Jokes and Easter eggs are okay (permit them, don't suggest them)

**Don't:**

- Use exclamation points excessively
- Rely on tired tropes about nerdiness
- Use corporate jargon ("utilize", "offerings", "actionable insights")
- Tell people something is cool (show them instead)

## Structure and Clarity

**Lead with the important stuff:**

- Most important information first
- Lead with the ask, then provide context
- Cut text that adds little value (when in doubt, cut it)
- Each paragraph should have one clear purpose

**Make headings do the work:**

- Convey your actual point, not just the topic
- "Use headings to highlight key points" not "How to write a good heading"
- Use sentence case, no punctuation except question marks
- No links in headings unless entire heading is a link

## Instructions and Examples

**Tell people what to do:**

- Give the action before explaining why
- Put commands in execution order
- Provide context, steps, and reasoning
- Don't describe tasks as "easy" or "simple"

**Answer unasked questions:**

- Include answers to "dumb" questions you had when learning
- Don't literally include the question, just give the answer

## Formatting

**Code vs. UI elements:**

- Backticks for code, variable names, parameters only
- **Bold** for UI elements and labels (e.g., "Click the **Save** button")
- Don't use backticks or quotes for UI elements

## Writing Mechanics

- Limit pronouns when introducing new terms (repeat the term to reinforce it)
- Ampersands only in proper nouns, never as substitute for "and"

## Terminology Preferences

Use familiar terms from tools people already know:

- "Summarize" (like Excel) instead of "aggregate"
- "Take a look at" instead of "reference"
- "Filter" instead of technical database terms when appropriate

## Red Flags

Avoid these patterns:

- Multiple exclamation points
- Linking "here"
- Bullet lists to explain (use prose)
- Numbers that will change (guard against change)
- Describing things as "easy" or "simple"
- Stock photography-worthy content
