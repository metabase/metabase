  "Honey SQL 2 replacements for [[toucan.db/query]] and [[toucan.db/reducible-query]]. These are here to ease our
  transition to Honey SQL 2 and Toucan 2. Once we switch over to the latter we can hopefully remove this namespace.

  PRO TIPS:

  1. You can enable debug logging for the compiled SQL locally by setting the log level for this namespace to
     `:trace`:

     ```
     (metabase.test/set-ns-log-level! 'metabase.db.query :trace)
     ```

  2. If using CIDER, set

     ```
     (setq cider-stacktrace-fill-column nil)
     ```

     So the nicely-formatted SQL in error messages doesn't get wrapped into a big blob in the `*cider-error*` buffer."
