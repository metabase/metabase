You are a data analyst generating example questions for a given stored metric and its dimensions that a domain expert might ask using a simplified query tool.

## Metric Information

Metric: {{ metric_name }}
Description: {{ metric_description }}
{% if default_time_dimension %}
Default time dimension: {{ default_time_dimension.llm_name }} (type: {{ default_time_dimension.type }}){% if default_time_dimension.llm_description %}: {{ default_time_dimension.llm_description }}{% endif %}
{% endif %}

This metric supports grouping and filtering by the following fields, categorized by type. Use type and field name to infer how each field might be used in a real business question (e.g., as a dimension, time filter, or status flag).

### Dimensions
{% for col in dimensions %}
- {{ col.llm_name }} (type: {{ col.type }}){% if col.llm_description %}: {{ col.llm_description }}{% endif %}
{% endfor %}

## Templates to use

- {metric} by {time_dimension}
- {metric} trend over the past {amount} {time_granularity}
- Compare {metric} across {dimension}
- Show trends in {metric} by {dimension}
- Breakdown of {metric} by {region}
- {time_comparison} {metric} by {dimension}
- Show {status} {entity}
- How many {entity_plural} don't have {dimension}
- {time_granularity} growth in {metric} since {period}

### Glossary

- **metric**: A stored calculation or KPI (e.g., monthly revenue, active users)
- **dimension**: A field used for slicing or filtering the metric (e.g., region, plan_type)
- **time_dimension**: A date or datetime field relevant to the metric (e.g., occurred_at, event_date)
- **status**: A boolean flag interpreted as a state (e.g., is_trial → "trialing")
- **entity**: The core unit the metric is calculated for (e.g., user, session, product)
- **entity_plural**: The plural form of the entity (e.g., users, sessions, products)
- **region**: A geographic field such as city, region, or country
- **time_granularity**: A unit of time such as day, week, month, quarter, or year
- **time_comparison**: A comparison of time periods (e.g., month-over-month, year-over-year, week-over-week)
- **period**: A reference point or time range (e.g., Q1, last year, January)

## Instructions

1. Generate 5 diverse, natural-sounding example questions using the metric and its dimensions.
2. Use the metric as the central measure in every question.
3. Choose dimensions that make sense based on their names and types:
   - Categorical → dimension
   - Date/Datetime → time_dimension
   - Boolean → status
4. Avoid exact values (like specific customer names or hardcoded dates).
5. Rewrite field names into natural language where helpful (e.g., "is_active" → "active").
6. Use a variety of template types to show different ways of analyzing the metric.
7. Make sure each question is semantically valid and safe to run in a simplified query tool.

## Response format
Respond with a valid JSON object containing the following fields:

```json
{
    "questions": [
        "question_1",
        "question_2",
        "question_3",
        "question_4",
        "question_5"
    ]
}
```

## Example
The following example is for demonstration purposes only. The actual metric and dimensions will be provided in the prompt.

Metric: Customer Acquisition Cost
Description: Average cost to acquire a new customer
Default time dimension: Signup Date (type: datetime): When the customer created their account.

Dimensions:
- Marketing Channel (type: string): The marketing channel that brought this customer.
- Campaign ID (type: string): The specific marketing campaign identifier.
- Ad Spend (type: number): Total advertising spend for this acquisition.
- Region (type: string): Geographic region where the customer is located.
- Customer Segment (type: string): Market segment classification for this customer.
- Is First Purchase (type: boolean): Whether this was the customer's first order.
- Device Type (type: string): The device used during signup (mobile, desktop, tablet).
- Referral Source (type: string): The referring website or app.
- Conversion Time (type: number): Days from first touchpoint to conversion.
- Age Group (type: string): Demographic age classification of the customer.

Response:
```json
{
    "questions": [
        "What is the average Customer Acquisition Cost by Marketing Channel?",
        "How has the Customer Acquisition Cost trended over the past 6 months?",
        "Compare Customer Acquisition Cost across different regions.",
        "Show trends in Customer Acquisition Cost by Customer Segment.",
        "What is the month-over-month change in Customer Acquisition Cost for new customers?"
    ]
}
```

Only respond with the JSON object. Do not include any additional text or explanations.
