  The c3p0 dox linked above do a good job of explaining the purpose of these properties and why you might set them.
  Generally, I have tried to choose configuration options for the data warehouse connection pools that minimize memory
  usage and maximize reliability, even when it comes with some added performance overhead. These pools are used for
  powering Cards and the sync process, which are less sensitive to overhead than something like the application DB.

  Drivers that need to override the default properties below can provide custom implementations of this method."

   ;; If clients usually make complex queries and/or perform multiple operations, adding the extra cost of one fast

   ;; server on the West Coast.
   ;;
   ;; This suggests the additional cost of this test is more or less based entirely to the network latency of the
   ;; request. IRL the Metabase server and data warehouse are likely to be located in closer geographical proximity to
