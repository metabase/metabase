*Note: For an in-depth description of Metabase's understanding of metadata and how it uses it, check out our [Metadata Guide](metadata-guide.md)*

###What is metadata?
**Metadata** is data about other data.  It's data that tells you about the data found in your database.
###Tables 

* Add descriptions to tables to let people know type of data a table contains and how it can be used. 
* Descriptions are displayed in the data model reference.
* You can control visibility of metadata by hiding it. 
* If you hide a field, give Metabase a reason so it understands why a field is not being included.

###Fields 

* If Metabase misclassified the type of a field, you can update it here. 
* Add a description to a field, so users know what data it contains.
* Descriptions are extra helpful when fields have values that are abbreviated or coded in a particular format.
* Descriptions are displayed in the data model reference.
