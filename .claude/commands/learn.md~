Make suggestions for new items to include in a CLAUDE.md memory file.
Consider if these suggestions should be included in the root project CLAUDE.md memory file or if they are better placed in a subdirectory memory file?
If there is a more appropriate subdirectory that should contain these new memory suggestions, check if a memory file exists in that subdirectory.
Detail why you are making any memory suggestions, explaining specifically what they will help with in the future.
