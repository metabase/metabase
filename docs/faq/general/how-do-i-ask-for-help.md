# How do I ask for help?

The best place to start when asking for help are our [Troubleshooting guides][troubleshooting]. We've compiled a list of common problems that users experience, along with common symptoms and error messages to help you diagnose and resolve your issues.

As hard as we've tried to make the documentation as complete as possible, we know that you might need additional help or have a general question about Metabase not answered here. If you're using the Enterprise Edition, please contact support via email or use the [contact form][contact]. If you're using the Open Source Edition, the best way to get help is to post on our [Discourse][discourse] and harness the power of our community.
