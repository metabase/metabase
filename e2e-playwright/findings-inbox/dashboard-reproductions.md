# dashboard-reproductions — findings

Port of `e2e/test/scenarios/dashboard/dashboard-reproductions.cy.spec.js`
(2388 lines, 41 tests) → `tests/dashboard-reproductions.spec.ts`.

Written incrementally during verification. Each entry is scoped to what was
actually observed — claims of product bugs are only made after the
cross-check against the original Cypress spec on the same backend.

## 1. NEW GOTCHA (port rule): `cy.tick(ms)` → `clock.runFor(ms)`, never `fastForward(ms)`

**Classification:** new gotcha → PORTING.md. Not a product bug.

Issue 12578 ("should not fetch cards that are still loading when refreshing")
failed with `gate.count()` = 0 (expected 1): the dashboard auto-refresh never
fired at all.

Root cause is a semantic difference between the two fake-clock APIs:

- Cypress `cy.tick(ms)` (Sinon) advances the clock firing **every** due timer.
- Playwright `clock.fastForward(ms)` jumps the clock and fires due timers
  **at most once**. `clock.runFor(ms)` is the one that fires them all.

`frontend/src/metabase/dashboard/hooks/use-dashboard-refresh-period.ts` drives
refresh from a **1-second** interval that increments a counter:

```ts
const TICK_PERIOD = 1; // seconds
elapsed.current = (elapsed.current || 0) + TICK_PERIOD;
if (period && elapsed.current >= period) { elapsed.current = 0; onRefresh(); }
useInterval(intervalFactor, TICK_PERIOD * 1000);
```

So reaching a 60s refresh period needs ~60 separate firings. `cy.tick(61_000)`
delivers 61; `fastForward(61_000)` delivered 1, `elapsed` reached 1, and no
refresh ever happened.

**Why this one matters beyond the single test:** the same substitution in issue
28756 was *silently passing*. That test asserts a toast does **not** appear
after `TOAST_TIMEOUT`. Under-firing timers means the toast's timer chain may
never run, so the assertion passes vacuously — a green test proving nothing.
`fastForward` weakens every negative-assertion timer test it touches. Both
sites now use `runFor`.

**Fix pattern for PORTING.md:** `cy.tick(ms)` → `page.clock.runFor(ms)`.
Only reach for `fastForward` when the intent really is "jump time without
running the intervening timers" — and never under a negative assertion.

## 2. NEW GOTCHA (port rule): Cypress `:visible` treats `opacity: 0` as hidden — Playwright's does not

**Classification:** new gotcha → PORTING.md. Not a product bug.

Issue 31274 ("should not clip dashcard actions") failed: the port's
`.filter({ visible: true })` on `dashboardcard-actions-panel` resolved to **3**
elements where Cypress's `.filter(":visible")` resolves to 1.

`DashCard.tsx` renders an actions panel for **every** card while
`isEditingDashboardLayout`, and `DashCardActionsPanel.module.css` hides them
with `opacity: 0; pointer-events: none`; `DashCard.module.css` fades in only
the hovered card's panel (`&:hover { .DashCardActionsPanel { opacity: 1 } }`).

The two harnesses disagree on what "visible" means:

- **Cypress** overrides jQuery's `:visible` with its own algorithm, which
  explicitly treats `opacity: 0` as hidden → 1 match.
- **Playwright** `{ visible: true }` = non-empty bounding box + not
  `visibility:hidden`. **Opacity is ignored** → 3 matches.

(Note this is *not* jQuery semantics either — bare jQuery `:visible` ignores
opacity too and would also return 3. The behaviour is Cypress-specific.)

**Fix pattern:** added `countOpaqueElements(locator)` to
`support/dashboard-repros.ts` (filters on computed `opacity !== "0"`), and
scoped the close-icon lookup to the hovered dashcard. Any hover-revealed
affordance ported from a `:visible` filter needs this treatment.

## 3. KNOWN GOTCHA instance: `cy.wait` on a pre-registered alias consuming a backlogged response (issue 17879 ×4)

**Classification:** known gotcha (PORTING.md "cy.wait after non-triggering
clicks"). Port bug, now fixed. Not a product bug.

All four 17879 tests failed on `waitForResponse` timing out after
`saveDashboard`. Upstream:

```js
cy.intercept("POST", `/api/dashboard/${dashboard.id}/dashcard/*/card/*/query`)
  .as("getCardQuery");        // registered BEFORE visitDashboard
...
H.saveDashboard();
cy.wait("@getCardQuery");     // satisfied by the INITIAL LOAD's response
```

Saving the dashboard changes no parameters and fires no new dashcard query, so
the upstream `cy.wait` only consumes a response recorded during the initial
dashboard load — it asserts nothing about the post-save state. The faithful
Playwright translation (`waitForResponse` registered at the true trigger) has
nothing to wait for and hangs.

Fixed by dropping the wait; the subsequent chart-circle locator auto-waits for
the re-rendered chart, which is what the wait was standing in for. This is a
textbook instance of the documented gotcha — a second one in this spec family
(`dashboard-filters-reproductions-1` reported the same shape).

## 4. INFRA DISCOVERY (high value): per-worker backends inherit `site-url=http://localhost:4000` from the snapshot, breaking every drill-through/click-behavior navigation

**Classification:** harness/infra bug in the per-worker-backend experiment.
**Not a product bug. Not a port bug.** Fixed in `support/worker-backend.ts`.

### Symptom

All four issue-17879 tests drill through a click-behavior custom destination
and then assert on the target question's filter. They failed with
`qb-filters-panel` **not found** — after `expect(page).toHaveURL(/\/question/)`
had *passed*.

### Root cause (mechanism confirmed in source)

1. `e2e/snapshots/*` were captured against the standard dev backend on
   **:4000**, so they carry `site-url = http://localhost:4000`. Verified live:
   `GET :4102/api/setting/site-url` → `http://localhost:4000`.
   `mb.restore()` reinstates it on every test.
2. `frontend/src/metabase/visualizations/lib/open-url.ts:105`:
   `url = ignoreSiteUrl ? url : getWithSiteUrl(url)`.
3. `frontend/src/metabase/utils/dom.ts:66` — `getWithSiteUrl` prefixes any
   root-relative URL with site-url: `/question#…` →
   `http://localhost:4000/question#…`.
4. `window.location.origin` on a slot backend is `http://localhost:4102`, so
   `isSameOrigin` is false → no client-side navigation → `clickLink()` does a
   **full page load of :4000**, a different backend that has none of the
   test's data → "We're a little lost".

`toHaveURL(/\/question/)` passes because `http://localhost:4000/question#…`
matches the regex — the test sails past the wrong-origin navigation and only
dies later, at the filter assertion. A nastier failure than a hard 404.

On the normal setup (backend on :4000) site-url == the page origin, so this is
invisible. **It only manifests on a backend whose port isn't 4000** — i.e.
exactly the per-worker-backend mode this spike is evaluating.

### Evidence it is not a product bug

- The **original Cypress spec** fails these 4 identically on the same backend
  (`MB_JETTY_PORT=4102`), so the port is faithful.
- The failure is fully explained by an environment value (`site-url`) that is
  wrong *for this harness*, not by application logic.
- Cypress's screenshot shows the smoking gun directly: the browser sitting on
  `http://localhost:4000/question#…` displaying "We're a little lost".

### Fix

`support/worker-backend.ts` now boots each slot backend with
`MB_SITE_URL=http://localhost:<port>`. Settings resolve env before the app DB,
so this pins the right origin and **survives `restore()`** (a value written
into the DB would not).

### Why this matters beyond this spec

Any test navigating via `openUrl` is affected on **every** slot backend, and
the failure is silent-ish (the URL still matches `/question`), so it surfaces
as a confusing downstream assertion rather than an obvious error. Every port
verified on a slot backend before this fix was running with a mis-set
`site-url`.

**Relationship to RESUME.md open thread 3 — a hypothesis, NOT a conclusion.**
It is tempting to blame this for `dashboard-filters-reproductions-1`'s 6
unexplained `test.fixme`s ("dashcard title drill-through does not carry the
dashboard filter's value"), and that thread's stated decider ("is CI's Cypress
leg green?") would be satisfied by a site-url delta without explaining it. But
**the symptoms do not match**:

- Mine: a **cross-origin** full page load to `:4000`; the URL *does* carry its
  hash/query, and the page 404s in-app ("We're a little lost").
- Theirs: the navigation appears same-origin and the **search string is empty**
  (`expected '' to include '2029-01-01~'`). If site-url were the cause there,
  the URL would have been rewritten to `:4000` *with* the search string intact
  and their assertion would have passed, not seen `''`.

Their drill is a dashcard **title** click, which I have not confirmed routes
through `openUrl` at all (it may be a react-router `Link`, which never touches
`getWithSiteUrl`). So: **plausible, unproven, and the observed evidence points
away from it.** The cheap decider is one step: temporarily un-fixme one of
those 6 and run it against a slot backend booted with `MB_SITE_URL`. I did not
do this — the spec is landed and owned by another agent, and I did not want to
leave debris in it. Recommended for whoever picks that thread up.

## 5. UNRESOLVED (1 `test.fixme`): issue 12926 native card shows no parameter-mapping options

**Classification:** faithful port; upstream behaviour on this environment.
**NOT claimed as a product bug** — see below.

`issue 12926 › saving a dashboard that retriggers a non saved query (negative
id) › should load the card with correct parameters after save` fails: the
dashcard's "Select…" mapping button never renders. The card instead renders
`DisabledNativeCardHelpText`, which only happens when
`isNative && isDisabled && question && editingParameter` — and
`isDisabled = mappingOptions.length === 0`
(`DashCardParameterMapper/DashCardCardParameterMapper.tsx:85`).

So `getParameterMappingOptions` returned `[]`, even though by inspection it
should return one option:

- The parameter is `number/=` (the sidebar shows type Number / operator Equal
  to, and the help text is the `isNumberParameter` branch).
- The template tag `F` is `type: "number"` (confirmed: the tag survives the API
  round-trip — the card returns it under MBQL5 `stages[0].template-tags`).
- `tagFilterForParameter` (`metabase-lib/v1/parameters/utils/filters.ts:119`)
  maps `number` + operator `=` → `(tag) => tag.type === "number"` → true.

That points at `question.legacyNativeQuery()` not surfacing variables, but I
did not confirm it, and note the card also returns `parameters: []`.

**Fidelity cross-check (the deciding step):** the ORIGINAL Cypress spec fails
identically at the same assertion on the same backend — both at Cypress's
default 4s timeout and with `defaultCommandTimeout=30000`. The port is
faithful; this is not a port defect and not a timeout artifact.

**Why no bug is being claimed:** "Cypress fails identically" does **not** rule
out the environment here, because both harnesses load the *same* rspack hot
bundle from `:8080` and hit the same source-mode backend. A frontend-side cause
would fail both harnesses identically and look exactly like this. FINDINGS #24
was retracted for precisely this inference, and RESUME.md flags a sibling
`parameters: []` thread (#2/#22) still awaiting the same jar re-verification.

**Next step (one concrete action):** re-run this single test against the CI
uberjar + static assets — the procedure that retracted #24. If it fails there
too, it is a real regression worth an issue; if it passes, the cause is local
environment and the fixme comes off.

## 6. Methodology note: a Cypress baseline taken under load is not a baseline

My first Cypress cross-check ran with Cypress's default 4s `defaultCommandTimeout`
against a machine running three other agents' Playwright suites + JVMs: **20/41
failed**. Re-running with `defaultCommandTimeout=30000` (matching the port's
timeouts) made several of those pass (12926-undo, 13736). A Cypress baseline
taken under load is not a valid comparison for a port that runs with 30s
timeouts — match the timeouts before concluding "Cypress fails too".
