title: "Bookmark"
summary: |
  Handle creating bookmarks for the user. Bookmarks are in three tables and should be thought of as a tuple of (model,
    model-id) rather than a row in a table with an id. The DELETE takes the model and id because DELETE's do not
    necessarily support request bodies. The POST is therefore shaped in this same manner. Since there are three
    underlying tables the id on the actual bookmark itself is not unique among 'bookmarks' and is not a good
    identifier for using in the API.

# Bookmark

Handle creating bookmarks for the user. Bookmarks are in three tables and should be thought of as a tuple of (model,
  model-id) rather than a row in a table with an id. The DELETE takes the model and id because DELETE's do not
  necessarily support request bodies. The POST is therefore shaped in this same manner. Since there are three
  underlying tables the id on the actual bookmark itself is not unique among "bookmarks" and is not a good
  identifier for using in the API.
