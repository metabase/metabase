;; NOTE: Being able to *execute* these queries and grok the results would actually be really powerful, if we can
;; achieve it with moderate cost. I think we can, at least for most queries. Some temporal stuff is a huge PITA,
;; but we can get the regular filters and aggregations nicely.
;; Queries which return nothing are valid, and we should generate them, but they're less interesting than those with
;; partial or complete return values!

;; Random Walk =======================================================================================================
;; The below is an approach to generating a space of all possible queries by iteratively taking "steps" with weighted
;; probabilities. Most steps actually come as pairs: adding and removing something.
;; Many steps come in groups, each choosing one of several possible columns to act on.
;;
;; In terms of tests exploring this space, I think there are several useful types:
;; - Checking properties of one query: given a random query, it must satisfy some property.
;;   - No duplicate names, sanity checks, etc.
;; - Checking before/after properties of a step: each step knows what it should do to the query.
;;   - Eg. after adding an aggregation, `lib/aggregations` must return something new, in the last position, that tracks
;;     with what we just added.
;; - Checking before/after/reversal properties of an invertible step, likewise.

;; Bonus: the FE tests should be able to hook into these CLJC functions, and run the single query checks and the
;; before/after steps after taking the action in the UI!

;; Design Notes ======================================================================================================
;; We have to make sure that simple, singular cases are not drowned out by large families of options. Eg. the set of
;; possible aggregations to add on a stage has one `:count` and perhaps 200 of sum, avg, min, max, etc. multiplied by
;; 20 columns. Therefore we choose the operator first, and then fill in any extra details afterward.
;;
;; To generate the next query in a sequence, we have three possible actions:
;; 1. Throw away this query and start over.
;; 2. "Pop" the previous step and do something else from that earlier branch.
;; 3. Take a further step atop this query.
;;
;; By tuning those probabilities, we can get a good balance of many basic queries or a variety of "deeper" queries.
;; See the bottom of the file for some

;; - Better is a guided series of weighted choices: x% chance the next step is aggregating.
;;   - Then having decided to aggregate, uniformly pick one of ~8 operators, and uniformly pick a column if needed.
;;   - That preserves the density of interesting cases like :count vs. a swarm of samey :min clauses.
;; - The generators are powered by inner functions that actually produce a `[:step ...]` command.
;; - The interface for defining steps shouldn't need to think too hard about generators.
;;   - It can work like `for` except that each line is choosing probabilistically from a list of choices.
;; - The context contains a stack of previous queries, so we can (with some probability) pop back up that stack to
;;   abandon a branch we've been exploring and try something else.
