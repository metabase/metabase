  "Code for setting up the application DB -- verifying that we can connect and for running migrations. Unlike code in
  `metabase.db`, code here takes a `clojure.java.jdbc` spec as a parameter; the higher-level code in `metabase.db`
  presents a similar set of functions but passes in the default (i.e., env var) application DB connection details
  automatically.

  Because functions here don't know where the JDBC spec came from, you can use them to perform the usual application
  DB setup steps on arbitrary databases -- useful for functionality like the `load-from-h2` or `dump-to-h2` commands."
