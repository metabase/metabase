# Radio & Radio.Group

Our themed wrapper around [Mantine Radio](https://mantine.dev/core/radio/).

## When to use Radio

Radio buttons allow users to select a single option from a list of mutually exclusive options. All possible options are exposed up front for users to compare.

## Caveats

- As of right now, don't use the size prop.
- Please don't use the `error` prop on Radio components (We'll standardize on this as other inputs get converted).

## Usage guidelines

- **Limit usage to 5 options max**. Radio buttons should be used when there are 2-3 options to choose from. If there are more than 5 options, consider using a [Select](../Select) or [Checkbox](../Checkbox) instead.
- For option ordering, try to use your best judgement on a sensible order. For example, Yes should come before No. Alphabetical ordering is usually a good fallback if there's no inherent order in your set of choices.
- In almost all circumstances you'll want to use `<Raio.Group>` to provide a set of options and help with defaultValues and state management between them.

## General

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Default">
    <Radio.Group defaultValue="yes">
      <Radio label="Yes" value="yes" />
      <Radio label="No" value="no" />
    </Radio.Group>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Disabled

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Disabled">
    <Radio.Group value="yes">
      <Radio label="Yes" value="yes" disabled />
      <Radio label="No" value="no" disabled />
    </Radio.Group>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Description

If needed you can add a description value to a radio button to give more context about the choice.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Descriptions">
    <Radio.Group defaultValue="chocolate">
      <Radio
        label="Chocolate"
        value="chocolate"
        description="One of our most popular flavors"
      />
      <Radio
        label="Vanilla"
        value="vanilla"
        description="A classic for all seasons"
      />
      <Radio
        label="Swirl"
        value="swirl"
        description="Why not have it both ways?"
      />
    </Radio.Group>
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Using the Radio group props

You can use `label` and `description` on the Radio.Group component to provide a label and description for the set of choices.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Radio Group props">
    <Radio.Group
      label="A set of options"
      description="You could so something like this if there was a deprecated setting that a user needs to update."
      defaultValue="one"
    >
      <Radio label="Old bad setting" value="one" disabled />
      <Radio label="A better newer setting" value="two" />
    </Radio.Group>
  </Story>
</Canvas>
