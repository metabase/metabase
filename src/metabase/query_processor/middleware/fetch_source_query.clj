(ns metabase.query-processor.middleware.fetch-source-query
  "Middleware responsible for 'hydrating' the source query for queries that use another query as their source. This
  middleware looks for MBQL queries like

    {:source-table \"card__1\" ; Shorthand for using Card 1 as source query
     ...}

  and resolves the referenced source query, transforming the query to look like the following:

    {:source-query    {...} ; Query for Card 1
     :source-metadata [...] ; metadata about columns in Card 1
     ...}

  This middleware resolves Card ID `:source-table`s at all levels of the query, but the top-level query often uses the
  so-called `virtual-id`, because the frontend client might not know the original Database; this middleware will
  replace that ID with the approiate ID, e.g.

    {:database <virtual-id>, :type :query, :query {:source-table \"card__1\"}}
    ->
    {:database 1, :type :query, :query {:source-query {...}, :source-metadata {...}}}
