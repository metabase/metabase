  "Interface to a library of generic graph walking functionality.

  Used for eg. walking the `enterprise/dependencies` graph, or similar directed graphs.

  Implementation-agnostic! The graph representation is wrapped by a protocol exported from this module, which can be
  used to write graph searches which can run in memory, against AppDB, on the filesystem, etc.

  Each graph defines an arbitrary **key**. This can be any hash map key, such as a number, a `[type id]` pair, etc."
