# Parameters for static embeds

Also known as: parameters for signed embeds, or standalone embeds.

Parameters are pieces of information that are passed between Metabase and your website via the [embedding URL](./static-embedding.md#adding-the-embedding-url-to-your-website). You can use parameters to specify how Metabase items should look and behave inside the iframe on your website.

## Types of parameters

Parameters can be signed or unsigned.

**Signed parameters**, such as filter names and values, must be added to your server code.

- [Editable parameters](#adding-a-filter-widget-to-a-static-embed)
- [Locked parameters](#restricting-data-in-a-static-embed)

**Unsigned parameters**, such as appearance settings, should be added directly to your iframe's `src` attribute.

- [Default values for editable parameters](#populating-an-embedded-filter-widget-with-a-default-value)
- [Visibility settings for editable parameters](#hiding-filter-widgets-from-a-static-embed)
- [Appearance settings](#customizing-the-appearance-of-a-static-embed)

## Adding a filter widget to a static embed

You can use **editable parameters** to add [filter widgets](https://www.metabase.com/glossary/filter_widget) to embedded dashboards or SQL questions.

1. Go to your dashboard or SQL question. Make sure you've set up a [dashboard filter](../dashboards/filters.md) or [SQL variable](../questions/native-editor/sql-parameters.md).
2. Click on the **sharing icon** > **Embed this item in an application**.
3. Under **Parameters**, you'll find the names of your dashboard filters or SQL variables.
4. Select **Editable** for each parameter that should get a filter widget on your embed.
5. Click **Publish** to save your changes.
6. Add or update the code on your server to [match the code generated by Metabase](./static-embedding.md#previewing-the-code-for-an-embed).

Editable parameters are responsible for passing filter values from the embedded filter widget (displayed on the iframe) through to the filters on your original dashboard or SQL question (in your Metabase).

### You can't disable parameters when the original question or dashboard requires a value

If the filter on a dashboard or question is set to [Always require a value](../dashboards/filters.md#requiring-a-filter), you won't be able to disable the parameter when embedding.

## Populating an embedded filter widget with a default value

If you want to set a default value for your [editable filter widget](#adding-a-filter-widget-to-a-static-embed), you can pass that default value to the corresponding parameter name in your iframe's `src` attribute:

```
your_embedding_url?parameter_name=value
```

Let's say your embedded dashboard has a filter connected to an editable parameter called "Breakfast". If you want to set the default value for the "Breakfast" filter to "Scrambled eggs":

```
your_embedding_url?breakfast=Scrambled_eggs
```

To specify default values for more than one filter, separate the filters with ampersands (&):

```
your_embedding_url?breakfast=Scrambled_eggs&lunch=Grilled_cheese
```

You can set multiple default values for a filter by separating the `key=value` pairs with ampersands (&):

```
your_embedding_url?breakfast=Scrambled_eggs&breakfast=Bacon
```

## Hiding filter widgets from a static embed

If you have a lot of editable parameters (resulting in a lot of filter widgets), you can hide them from your static embed by adding `#hide_parameters` to the end of the URL in your iframe's `src` attribute:

```
your_embedding_url#hide_parameters=parameter_name
```

For example, if you want to hide a filter called "Breakfast" from your embedded dashboard:

```
your_embedding_url#hide_parameters=breakfast
```

You can hide multiple filter widgets by separating the parameter names with commas:

```
your_embedding_url#hide_parameters=breakfast,lunch
```

You can also simultaneously assign a parameter a default value _and_ hide its filter widget:

```
your_embedding_url?breakfast=Scrambled_eggs#hide_parameters=breakfast
```

## Unsigned parameter syntax

Whenever you're adding a parameter to the embedding URL in your iframe's `src` attribute, note that:

- Parameter _names_ are lowercase.
- Parameter _values_ are case-sensitive (the values must match your data).
- Spaces should be replaced by underscores.

## Restricting data in a static embed

If you want to restrict the data that's displayed in an embedded dashboard or SQL question, you can set up a **locked parameter**. A locked parameter filters the data in a dashboard or SQL question _before_ the results are displayed to people in a static embed.

1. Go to your dashboard or SQL question. Make sure you've set up a [dashboard filter](../dashboards/filters.md) or [SQL variable](../questions/native-editor/sql-parameters.md).
2. Click on the **sharing icon** > **Embed this item in an application**.
3. Under **Parameters**, you'll find the names of your dashboard filters or SQL variables.
4. Select **Locked** for each parameter that you want to restrict your data with.
5. Optional: select a value under **Preview locked parameters** to see what the restricted data looks like.
6. Click **Publish** to save your changes.
7. Add or update the code on your server to [match the code generated by Metabase](./static-embedding.md#previewing-the-code-for-an-embed).

You can use locked parameters to display filtered data based on attributes captured by your web server, such as a username or a tenant ID. For more examples, see the [reference apps repo](https://github.com/metabase/embedding-reference-apps).

Locked parameters will apply the selected filter values to your original dashboard or SQL question, but they won't be displayed as filter widgets on your embed. Locked parameters may also limit the values that are shown in your [editable filter widgets](#adding-a-filter-widget-to-a-static-embed).

If you just want to require a value for the parameter, you could set the filter as editable and configure the underlying question or dashboard to [always require a value](../dashboards/filters.md#requiring-a-filter).

## Updating a locked parameter

Things to keep in mind if you need to make changes to your locked parameters.

### Include all locked parameters in your server code

Once you publish a chart or dashboard with a locked parameter, you _must_ include the name of the locked parameter in your server code. If you exclude the parameter name, the logs will gently remind you: `You must specify a value for :parameter in the JWT`.

If you don't want the locked filter to apply, you can pass an empty array, `[]`, as the value for the parameter in the JWT.

### Make sure the filter name matches the locked parameter name

If you change the name of a query builder filter that's used as a locked parameter, make sure to update the parameter's name and value(s) in your server code as well. If your locked parameter is connected to a [SQL variable](../questions/native-editor/sql-parameters.md), you don't need to change the parameter's name and value(s).

### Multiple locked parameters or multiple values

The values for the locked parameter in your server code should match your filter's values exactly. The best way to set multiple locked parameters, or pass multiple values to a locked parameter, is to pick a filter value under **Preview locked parameters** and [preview the server code generated by Metabase](./static-embedding.md#previewing-the-code-for-an-embed).

## Locked parameters on dashboards with SQL questions

If your [locked parameter](#restricting-data-in-a-static-embed) is linked to a dashboard filter that's in turn linked to a SQL question, you'll only be able to choose a _single_ value for your locked parameter.

For example, let's say you have a dashboard filter called "Breakfast" with the values "Hash browns", "Muffin", and "Waffles". If the "Breakfast" filter is linked to _any_ SQL questions on the dashboard, you'll only be able to choose _one_ of the options for a locked parameter linked to the "Breakfast" filter.

## Customizing the appearance of a static embed

You can change the appearance of an embedded item by adding hash parameters to the end of the URL in your iframe's `src` attribute.

For example, the following embedding URL will display an embedded item in dark mode, without a border, and with its original title:

```
your_embedding_url#theme=night&bordered=false&titled=true
```

You can preview appearance settings from your question or dashboard's [embedded appearance settings](./static-embedding.md#customizing-the-appearance-of-static-embeds).

| Parameter name                            | Possible values                               |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `bordered`                                | true, false                                   |
| `titled`                                  | true, false                                   |
| `theme`                                   | null, transparent, night                      |
| `refresh` (dashboard only)                | integer (seconds, e.g., `refresh=60`)         |
| `font`\*                                  | [font name](../configuring-metabase/fonts.md) |
| `hide_download_button`\* (questions only) | true, false                                   |

### Allow people to download the results of an embedded question

{% include plans-blockquote.html feature="Downloading results" %}

By default, Metabase will include a **Download** button on embedded questions. You can remove the download button by setting `hide_download_button=true` in the embedding URL in the iframe's `src` attribute, see [customizing the appearance of static embeds](./static-embedding.md#customizing-the-appearance-of-static-embeds).

If the download button is missing when you expected it to be available, check that the URL in the `src` attribute for your iframe has the parameter `hide_download_button=false`.

> Downloading results is available only for questions, not dashboards.

## Maximum request size

The maximum length of a static embedding URL (including all parameters) is the value of your [`MB_JETTY_REQUEST_HEADER_SIZE`](../configuring-metabase/environment-variables.md#mb_jetty_request_header_size) environment variable. The default is 8192 bytes.

If your static embedding URL exceeds the maximum header size, you'll see a log message like `URI too long`. You can update the environment variable to accept larger headers. If you're using a proxy server, you may need to set a corresponding property on the server as well.
