(ns metabase.models.humanization
  "Logic related to humanization of table names and other identifiers, e.g. taking an identifier like `my_table` and
  returning a human-friendly one like `My Table`.

  There are currently three implementations of humanization logic; `:advanced`, cost-based logic is the default; which
  implementation is used is determined by the Setting `humanization-strategy`; `:simple`, which merely replaces
  underscores and dashes with spaces, and `:none`, which predictibly is merely an identity function that does nothing
  to the results.

  The actual algorithm for advanced humanization is in `metabase.util.infer-spaces`. (NOTE: some of the logic is here,
  such as the `captialize-word` function; maybe we should move that so all the logic is in one place?)"
