(ns metabase.query-processor.util.add-alias-info
  "Walks query and generates appropriate aliases for every selected column; and adds extra keys to the
  corresponding MBQL clauses with this information. Deduplicates aliases and calls [[metabase.driver/escape-alias]]
  with the generated aliases. Adds information about the aliases in source queries and joins that correspond to
  columns in the parent level.

  This code is currently opt-in, and is currently only used by SQL drivers ([[metabase.driver.sql.query-processor]]
  manually calls [[add-alias-info]] inside of [[metabase.driver.sql.query-processor/mbql->native]]
  and [[metabase.driver.mongo.query-processor/mbql->native]]) but at some point in the future this may
  become general QP middleware that can't be opted out of.

  [[add-alias-info]] adds some or all of the following keys to every `:field` clause, `:expression` reference, and
  `:aggregation` reference:

  ##### `::source-table`

  String name, integer Table ID, the keyword `::source`, or the keyword `::none`. Use this alias to qualify the clause
  during compilation.

  - String names are aliases for joins. This name should be used literally.

  - An integer Table ID means this comes from the `:source-table`; use the Table's schema and name to qualify the
    clause. (Some databases also need to qualify Fields with the Database name.)

  - `::source` means this clause comes from the `:source-query`; the alias to use is theoretically driver-specific but
    in practice is `source` (see [[metabase.driver.sql.query-processor/source-query-alias]]).

  - `::none` means this clause SHOULD NOT be qualified at all. `::none` is currently only used in some very special
     circumstances, specially by the Spark SQL driver when compiling Field Filter replacement snippets. But it's here
     for those sorts of cases where we need it.

  TODO -- consider allowing vectors of multiple qualifiers e.g. `[schema table]` or `[database schema table]` as well
  -- so drivers that need to modify these can rewrite this info appropriately.

  ##### `::source-alias`

  String name to use to refer to this clause during compilation.

  ##### `::desired-alias`

  If this clause is 'selected' (i.e., appears in `:fields`, `:aggregation`, or `:breakout`), select the clause `AS`
  this alias. This alias is guaranteed to be unique.

  ##### `::position`

  If this clause is 'selected', this is the position the clause will appear in the results (i.e. the corresponding
  column index)."
