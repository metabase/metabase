;; ## NEW PERMISSIONS CHECKING MACROS
;; Since checking `@can_read`/`@can_write` is such a common pattern, these
;; macros eliminate a bit of the redundancy around doing so.
;; They support two forms:
;;
;;     (read-check my-table) ; checks @(:can_read my-table)
;;     (read-check Table 1)  ; checks @(:can_read (sel :one Table :id 1))
;;
;; *  The first form is useful when you've already fetched an object (especially in threading forms such as `->404`).
;; *  The second form takes care of fetching the object for you and is useful in cases where you won't need the object afterward
;;    or want to combine the `sel` and permissions check statements into a single form.
;;
;; Both forms will throw a 404 if the object doesn't exist (saving you one more check!) and return the selected object.
