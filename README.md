## Extending Metabase

Metabase also allows you to hit our Query API directly from Javascript to integrate the simple analytics we provide with your own application or third party services to do things like:

- Build moderation interfaces.
- Export subsets of your users to third party marketing automation software.
- Provide a specialized customer lookup application for the people in your company.
