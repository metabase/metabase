## Adding a database connection

At the top right of the screen, click on the **gear** icon > **Admin settings**.

Once in the Admin section, select the **Databases** tab from the navigation bar at the top of the screen. Youâ€™ll see a list of your connected databases (if any). To connect a database to Metabase, click **Add database** and follow the connection instructions for your database.

Although connection details differ database to database, in general you'll need to get connection info from your database admin, usually some combination of hostname (sometimes called endpoint), port, database username and password, and the name of the database.

## Connecting to supported databases

Metabase supports many different databases and data sources, with different levels of support.

- [Official](#officially-supported-databases) (this page)
- [Partner](../developers-guide-drivers.html)
- [Community](../developers-guide-drivers.html)

The following databases have official drivers maintained by the Metabase team. Customers on [paid plans](https://www.metabase.com/pricing/) will get official support.

- [BigQuery](./connections/bigquery.html) (Google Cloud Platform)

## Connecting to databases hosted by a cloud provider

For provider-specific connection details, like connecting to a PostgreSQL data warehouse on RDS:

- [AWS's Relational Database Service (RDS)](./connections/aws-rds.html)

## Database connection options

Connection options differ depending on which database you're connecting to. Here's an overview:

- [Use a secure connection (SSL)](#use-a-secure-connection-ssl)
- [Use an SSH-tunnel for database connections](#use-an-ssh-tunnel-for-database-connections)

**Advanced options**

- [Additional JDBC connection string options](#additional-jdbc-connection-string-options)
- [Re-run queries for simple explorations](#re-run-queries-for-simple-explorations)
- [Choose when Metabase syncs and scans](#choose-when-metabase-syncs-and-scans)
- [Periodically refingerprint tables](#periodically-refingerprint-tables)

### Use a secure connection (SSL)

Metabase automatically tries to connect to databases with SSL first, then without if that doesn't work. If it's possible to connect to your database with an SSL connection, Metabase will make that the default setting for your database. If you prefer to connect without this layer of security, you can always change this setting later, but we highly recommend keeping SSL turned on to keep your data secure.

### Use an SSH tunnel for database connections

See our [guide to SSH tunneling](./ssh-tunnel.html).

### Additional JDBC connection string options

Some databases allow you to append options to the connection string Metabase will use to connect to your database.

### Re-run queries for simple explorations

Turn this option **OFF** from **Advanced options** if people want to click **Run** (the play button) before applying Summarize or Filter options.

By default, Metabase will execute a query as soon as you choose an option from Summarize or Filter. If your database is slow, you may want to disable auto-run to avoid running into a load icon every time a Summarize or Filter option is clicked.

### Choose when Metabase syncs and scans

Turn this option **ON** from **Advanced options** to manage the queries that Metabase uses to stay up to date with your database. For more information, see [Database syncing and scanning](#database-syncing-and-scanning).

### Scheduling database syncs

If you've selected **Choose when syncs and scans happen** > **ON**, you'll see the following options under **Database syncing**:

- Scan: set the frequency of the [sync query](#how-database-syncs-work) to hourly (default) or daily.
- Time: when the sync query will run against your database (in the timezone of the server where your Metabase app is running).

### Scheduling database scans

If you've selected **Choose when syncs and scans happen** > **ON**, you'll see the following options under **Scanning for filter values**:

![Scanning options](./images/scanning-options.png)

- **Regularly, on a schedule** allows you to run [scan queries](#how-database-scans-work) at a frequency that matches the rate of change to your database. The time is set in the timezone of the server where your Metabase app is running. This is the best option for a small database, or tables with distinct values that get updated often.
- **Only when adding a new filter widget** is a great option if you have a relatively large database, but you still want to enable dashboard and SQL/native query filters. With this option enabled, Metabase will only scan and cache the values of the field or fields that are required whenever a new filter is added to a dashboard or SQL/native question. For example, if you were to add a dashboard category filter, mapped to one field called `Customer ID` and another one called `ID`, only those two fields would be scanned at the moment the filter is saved.
- **Never, I'll do this manually if I need to** is an option for databases that are either prohibitively large, or which never really have new values added. Use the **Re-scan field values now** button to run a manual scan and bring your filter values up to date.

### Periodically refingerprint tables

Turn this option **ON** from **Advanced options** to _scan a sample_ of values every time a sync is run.

A fingerprinting query examines the first 10,000 rows from each column and uses that data to guesstimate how many unique values each column has, what the minimum and maximum values are for numeric and timestamp columns, and so on. Metabase only fingerprints each column once, unless you explicitly tells it to fingerprint the column again, or in the rare event that a new release of Metabase changes the fingerprinting logic.

## Database syncing and scanning

Metabase runs sync and scan queries in order to show tables and columns, populate dropdown menus with the right values, and suggest helpful visualizations. Metabase does _not_ copy any data from your database---it only maintains lists of the tables and columns.

### How database syncs work

A Metabase **sync** query gets a list of updated table and column names from your database. The query runs against your database during setup, and again every hour by default. It's very fast with most relational databases, but can be slower with MongoDB and some [community-built database drivers](../developers-guide/partner-and-community-drivers.md). Syncing can't be turned off completely, otherwise Metabase wouldn't work.

### How database scans work

A Metabase **scan** query caches the column _values_ for filter dropdowns by looking at the first 1,000 distinct records from each table. A scan is more intensive than a sync query, so it only runs once during setup, and again once a day by default. If you [disable scans](#scheduling-database-scans) entirely, you'll need to bring things up to date by running [manual scans](#manually-scanning-column-values).

### Getting tables, columns, and values for the first time

When Metabase first connects to your database, it performs a **scan** to determine the metadata of the columns in your tables and automatically assign each column a [semantic type]().

During the scan, Metabase also takes a sample of each table to look for URLs, JSON, encoded strings, etc. You can map table and column metadata to new values from **Admin settings** > **Data model**. For more on editing metadata, check out [the Data Model page: editing metadata](../data-modeling/metadata-editing.html).

### Manually syncing table and column names

1. Go to **Admin settings** > **Databases** > your database.
2. Click on **Sync database schema now**.

![Database Manual Sync](./images/DatabaseManualSync.png)

### Manually scanning column values for filter menus

To scan values from all the columns in a table:

1. Go to **Admin settings** > **Data model**.
2. Select the table that you want to update from your database.
3. Click **Re-scan this table**.

To scan values from a specific column:

1. Go to **Admin settings** > **Data model**.
2. Select the table and find the column you want to update from your database.
3. Click **Re-scan this field**.

### Clearing cached values

Click **Discard cached field values** to forget the data that Metabase has stored from previous [database scans](#database-syncing-and-scanning).

## Deleting databases

**Caution: Deleting a database is irreversible! All saved questions and dashboard cards based on the database will be deleted as well!**

To delete a database from Metabase, click on **Remove this database** from the database detail screen.

![Database Manual Sync](./images/DatabaseManualSync.png)

You can also delete a database from the database list: hover over the row with the database you want to remove and click the **Delete** button that appears.
