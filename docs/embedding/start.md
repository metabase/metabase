# Embedding overview

## [Introduction](./introduction.md)

What is embedding, and how does it work?

## [Signed embedding](./signed-embedding.md)

Also known as Standalone Embedding, Signed Embedding offers drill-through with custom destinations, so you can define what happens when people click on a chart, like sending people to another chart or URLâ€“all while securing the underlying data.

## [Full-app embedding](./full-app-embedding.md)

Put all of Metabase in your app to give people secure self-serve access to data. You can still create custom destinations if you want, but Full-app Embedding integrates with your data permissions to let people slice and dice data on their own using Metabase's query builder.
