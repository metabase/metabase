  This name was used for both the `:display_name` in the query results, and for the `:name` used as an alias in the
  query (e.g. the right-hand side of a SQL `AS` expression). Because some custom display names weren't allowed by some
  drivers, or would be transformed in some way (for example, Redshift always lowercases custom aliases), this method
  was needed so we could match the name we had given the column with the one in the query results.

  In 0.33.0, we started using `:named` internally to alias aggregations in middleware in *all* queries to prevent
  issues with referring to multiple aggregations of the same type when that query was used as a source query.
  See [#9767](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/issues/9767) for more details. After this change, it became
  desirable to differentiate between such internally-generated aliases and display names, which need not be used in
