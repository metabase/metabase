     You can't ORDER BY something not in the SELECT, e.g. ORDER BY user.first_name would not make sense here.

  2. If the stage has no aggregations or breakouts, you can order by any visible Field:

     a. You can filter by any custom `:expressions` in this stage of the query

     b. You can filter by any Field 'exported' by the previous stage of the query, if there is one; otherwise you can
        filter by any Fields from the current `:source-table`.

     c. You can filter by any Fields exported by any explicit joins
