(s/defn ^:private resolve-params :- (s/maybe [{s/Keyword s/Any}])
  "Resolve the parmeters passed in to the API (`query-params`) and make sure they're actual valid parameters the
  Dashboard with `dashboard-id`. This is done to prevent people from adding in parameters that aren't actually present
  on the Dashboard. When successful, this will return a merged sequence based on the original `dashboard-params`, but
  including the `:value` from the appropriate query-param.

  The way we pass in parameters is complicated and silly: for public Dashboards, they're passed in as JSON-encoded
  parameters that look something like (when decoded):

      [{:type :category, :target [:variable [:template-tag :num]], :value \"50\"}]

  For embedded Dashboards they're simply passed in as query parameters, e.g.

      [{:num 50}]

  Thus resolving the params has to take either format into account. To further complicate matters, a Dashboard's
  `:parameters` column contains values that look something like:

       [{:name \"Num\", :slug \"num\", :id \"537e37b4\", :type \"category\"}

  This is sufficient to resolve slug-style params passed in to embedded Dashboards, but URL-encoded params for public
  Dashboards do not have anything that can directly match them to a Dashboard `:parameters` entry. However, they
  already have enough information for the query processor to handle resolving them itself; thus we simply need to make
  sure these params are actually allowed to be used on the Dashboard. To do this, we can match them against the
  `:parameter_mappings` for the Dashboard's DashboardCards, which look like:

      [{:card_id 1, :target [:variable [:template-tag :num]], :parameter_id \"537e37b4\"}]

  Thus for public Dashboards JSON-encoded style we can look for a matching Dashcard parameter mapping, based on
  `:target`, and then find the matching Dashboard parameter, based on `:id`.

  *Cries*

  TODO -- Tom has mentioned this, and he is very correct -- our lives would be much easier if we just used slug-style
  for everything, rather than the weird JSON-encoded format we use for public Dashboards. We should fix this!"
