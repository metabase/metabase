  "Generate \"interesting\" inputs for the automatic dashboard pipeline.

  In this context, \"interesting\" means \"grounded\" values. In particular, the most interesting values of all are
  metrics. Metrics are intrinsically interesting and can be displayed on their own. Dimensions and filters, while not
  interesting on their own, can be combined with metrics to add more interest to the metric. In MBQL parlance, metrics
  are aggregates, dimensions are breakouts, and filters are filters. However, a user-defined metric may go beyond a
  simple aggregate.

  Our main namespace function, `identify`, takes an object to be analyzed for interestingness and a data structure
  consisting of templates for interesting combinations of metrics, dimensions, and filters. In this stage, we return
  grounded metrics (inherently interesting) along with grounded dimensions and filters that can be combined with our
  grounded metrics downstream for added interest.

  The template arguments are defined in terms of Dimensions, Metrics, and Filters. These are *named* values, such as:
   - Dimension:
     - GenericNumber
     - Timestamp
     - Country
     - Longitude
     - Latitude
     - Income
     - Discount
   - Metric:
     - Count - Dimensionless
     - Sum - A metric over a single field
     - AverageDiscount - A metric defined by the Income and Discount fields (as an example)
   - Filter:
     - Last30Days - A named quantity that is defined by one or more constituent Dimensions

   Template Metrics and Filters are made up of some combination of field references (Dimensions). These are referenced
   using the Dimension names (e.g. Avg of some GenericNumber) despite these constituent fields technically not being
   Dimensions. Metrics and Dimensions should be thought of as orthogonal concerns, but for our matching algorithm, this
   is how constituent fields are selected.

   The \"grounding\" process binds individual fields to named Dimensions as well as constituent elements of Filter and
   Metric definitions.

   Note that the binding process is 1:N, where a single dimension may match to multiple fields.
   A field can only bind to one dimension.
