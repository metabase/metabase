## Getting and activating the Enterprise edition

The Enterprise edition of Metabase is distinct from the open-source edition, so to use it you'll need to first get a license, get the Enterprise edition, and then activate enterprise features with your license.

You can get a license by signing up for a free trial of the Enterprise edition. [Find out more here](https://metabase.com/enterprise/).

To get the Enterprise edition, you can either [download the latest .jar file](https://downloads.metabase.com/enterprise/latest/metabase.jar), or get the [latest Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/metabase/metabase-enterprise/) at `metabase/metabase-enterprise:latest`

Once you have the Enterprise edition running, to activate all of its features go to the Admin Panel within Metabase, click on the Enterprise tab, click the "Activate a license" button, and then paste in your license token. The page should change to show you that Enterprise features are now active.
