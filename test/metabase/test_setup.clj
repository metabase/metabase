;; ## GENERAL SETTINGS

;; Don't run unit tests whenever JVM shuts down
(expectations/disable-run-on-shutdown)


;; ## EXPECTATIONS FORMATTING OVERRIDES

;; These overrides the methods Expectations usually uses for printing failed tests.
;; These are basically the same as the original implementations, but they colorize and pretty-print the
;; output, which makes it an order of magnitude easier to read, especially for tests that compare a
;; lot of data, like Query Processor or API tests.
