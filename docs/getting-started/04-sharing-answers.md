##Step 4: Sharing answers with others

### Sharing answers directly

Once you have asked a question, the URL links directly to your answer. If you copy this URL, you can share it directly with anyone via email, IM or any other means.

### Saving questions

Some questions you'll find occur over and over again, whether it's a regular report you run, a common segment of users or products you look up or just a question others in your company keep asking you. To keep from repeating the same set of steps each time you want to re-ask the question, you can save the question for later use.

To do this, click on the "Save button"

Metabase will guess a meaningful name for the question, but you can (and should) use a naming scheme that helps you and others find it 6 months down the line.

Once you have saved the card, you'll have a few options depending on whether you are creating a batch of related cards, or if you want to ask a new question.

### Creating a dashboard

Sometimes there are a group of questions (and their associated answers) that are meant to be viewed together. Dashboards are made up of a number of saved questions which are displayed as Cards within a dashboard. To create your first dashboard, click on "Add to Dashboard" in the post question save confirmation message. 

If you don't have any dashboards already created, you should see a dialog that prompts you for a name.

Once you've added a card to a dashboard, you can go to the dashboard and see something similar to the below.

You now have a dashboard with your question that you can share! If you want to learn more, check out our [User Guide](../users-guide/start.md)
