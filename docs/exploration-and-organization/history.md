# History

For questions, dashboards, and models, Metabase keeps a version history for the previous fifteen versions of that item. You can view changes, and revert to previous versions.

## Viewing tracked changes

1. Go to your question, dashboard, or model.
2. Click the info icon.
3. Click on the **History** tab.
4. The History tab will display the item's history of up to 15 versions.

Metabase will keep track of a version each time you [save](../questions/sharing/answers.md#how-to-save-a-question), [move](../questions/sharing/answers.md#editing-your-question), [revert](#reverting-to-previous-versions), [move to Trash](./delete-and-restore.md), or [verify](./content-verification.md) an item.

## Reverting to previous versions

1. Go to your question, dashboard, or model.
2. Click the info icon (an **i** in a circle).
3. A sidebar will appear with up to fifteen previous versions.
4. Click on the **back arrow** beside a version to revert your item to that point in time.
