# IP addresses to whitelist

Since we host your Metabase for you, you may need to add our IP addresses to the whitelist for your security group or firewall rules so they don't block calls from your Metabase Cloud to your connected databases.

Here are the IP addresses we use in each region.

## United States (North Virginia) - `us-east-1`

```sh
18.207.81.126
3.211.20.157
50.17.234.169
```

## Europe (Frankfurt) - `eu-central-1`

```sh
18.192.2.142
18.184.191.58
3.65.184.173
```

## Asia Pacific (Singapore) - `ap-southeast-1`

```sh
54.179.42.215
3.1.176.8
18.139.48.211
```

## Asia Pacific (Sydney) - `ap-southeast-2`

```sh
