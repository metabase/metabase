# How do I ask for help?

The best place to start when asking for help are our [Troubleshooting guides](../../troubleshooting-guide/index.md). We’ve compiled a list of common problems that users experience, along with common symptoms and error messages to help you self-diagnose and resolve your issues.

As hard as we’ve tried to make the documentation as complete as possible, we know that you might need additional help or have a general question about Metabase not answered here. The best way to get help in these cases is to post on our [Discourse](https://discourse.metabase.com/) and harness the power of our community to get your question answered.

If you're using the Enterprise Edition, then please contact support via email or use the [contact form](https://www.metabase.com/contact/).
