**1. How to configure Metabase application database to be MySQL (instead of the default H2)**

1.1 Go to MySQL Command line :- Create database metabase;
1.2 Go to cmd :-
java -jar -DMB_DB_TYPE=mysql -DMB_DB_DBNAME=metabase -DMB_DB_PORT=3306 -DMB_DB_USER=xxx -DMB_DB_PASS=yyy metabase.jar

**Note**
Should always use above command to start metabase. If we use java -jar metabase.jar, the default H2 database will get created

**2. Assume we already have worked with H2 for some time. Now want to migrate this work to MySQL**

2.1 Go to MySQL Command line :- Create database metabase;
2.2 Go to cmd :-
java -jar -DMB_DB_TYPE=mysql -DMB_DB_DBNAME=metabase -DMB_DB_PORT=3306 -DMB_DB_USER=xxx -DMB_DB_PASS=yyy metabase.jar load-from-h2 ./metabase.db

(this assumes that the metabase.db file is in same path as metabase jar file)

2.3 In above step, after migration, metabase shuts down. To restart, use following
java -jar -DMB_DB_TYPE=mysql -DMB_DB_DBNAME=metabase -DMB_DB_PORT=3306 -DMB_DB_USER=xxx -DMB_DB_PASS=yyy metabase.jar

2.4 Remove metabase.db.mv and metabase.db.trace files from the folder and keep in another location as backup
