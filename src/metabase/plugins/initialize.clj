  "Logic related to initializing plugins, i.e. running the `init` steps listed in the plugin manifest. This is done when
  Metabase launches as soon as all dependencies for that plugin are met; for plugins with unmet dependencies, it is
  retried after other plugins are loaded (e.g. for things like BigQuery which depend on the shared Google driver.)

  Note that this is not the same thing as initializing *drivers* -- drivers are initialized lazily when first needed;
  this step on the other hand runs at launch time and sets up that lazy load logic."
