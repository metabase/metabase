  Metabase lib. Currently this is a little different from the version of MBQL consumed by the QP, specified

  Some primitives below are duplicated from [[metabase.util.malli.schema]] since that's not `.cljc`. Other stuff is

  See [[metabase.driver.sql.query-processor-test/join-source-queries-with-joins-test]] for example.

  This doesn't really make sense IMO (you should use string field refs to refer to things from a previous
  stage...right?) but for now we'll have to allow it until we can figure out how to go fix all of the old broken queries.

  Also, it's apparently legal to use a join alias to refer to a column that comes from a join in a source Card, and
  there is no way for us to know what joins exist in the source Card without a metadata provider, so we're just going
  to have to go ahead and skip validation in that case. Icky! But it's better than being overly strict and rejecting
  queries that the QP could have fixed.
