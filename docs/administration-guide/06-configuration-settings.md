###Base URL
The **base URL** is used in emails to allow users to click to their specific instance.  Include the protocol (http vs https) to make sure it is reachable. 

###Connection Timezone
The **connection timezone** sets the default time zone for displaying times.  The timezone is used when doing date breakouts.  

Setting the default timezone will not change the timezone of any data in your database.  If the underlying times in your database aren't assigned to a timezone, Metabase will use the connection timezone as the default timezone.  

###Name used for the Instance
If you want to name an instance, you can do so under settings.  Many teams use the name of their company, but the choice is yours!
