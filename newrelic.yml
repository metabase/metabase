  # ============================== LICENSE KEY ===============================
  # You must specify the license key associated with your New Relic
  # account. For example, if your license key is 12345 use this:
  # license_key: '12345'
  # The key binds your Agent's data to your account in the New Relic service.
  # license_key: '<%= license_key %>'

  # Agent Enabled
  # Use this setting to disable the agent instead of removing it from the startup command.
  # Default is true.
  agent_enabled: true

  # To enable high security, set this property to true. When in high
  # security mode, the agent will use SSL and obfuscated SQL. Additionally,
  # request parameters and message parameters will not be sent to New Relic.
  high_security: false

  # Set to true to enable support for auto app naming.
  # The name of each web app is detected automatically
  # and the agent reports data separately for each one.
  # This provides a finer-grained performance breakdown for
  # web apps in New Relic.
  # Default is false.
  enable_auto_app_naming: false

  # Set to true to enable component-based transaction naming.
  # Set to false to use the URI of a web request as the name of the transaction.
  # Default is true.
  enable_auto_transaction_naming: true

  # The agent uses its own log file to keep its logging
  # separate from that of your application.  Specify the log level here.
  # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application.
  # The levels in increasing order of verboseness are:
  #   off, severe, warning, info, fine, finer, finest
  # Default is info.
  log_level: info

  # Log all data sent to and from New Relic in plain text.
  # This setting is dynamic, so changes do not require restarting your application.
  # Default is false.
  audit_mode: false

  # The number of backup log files to save.
  # Default is 1.
  log_file_count: 1

  # The maximum number of kbytes to write to any one log file.
  # The log_file_count must be set greater than 1.
  # Default is 0 (no limit).
  log_limit_in_kbytes: 0

  # Override other log rolling configuration and roll the logs daily.
  # Default is false.
  log_daily: false

  # The name of the log file.
  # Default is newrelic_agent.log.
  log_file_name: newrelic_agent.log

  # The log file directory.
  # Default is the logs directory in the newrelic.jar parent directory.
  #log_file_path:

  # The agent communicates with New Relic via https by
  # default.  If you want to communicate with newrelic via http,
  # then turn off SSL by setting this value to false.
  # This work is done asynchronously to the threads that process your
  # application code, so response times will not be directly affected
  # by this change.
  # Default is true.
  ssl: true

  # Proxy settings for connecting to the New Relic server:
  # If a proxy is used, the host setting is required.  Other settings
  # are optional.  Default port is 8080.  The username and password
  # settings will be used to authenticate to Basic Auth challenges
  # from a proxy server.
  #proxy_host: hostname
  #proxy_port: 8080
  #proxy_user: username
  #proxy_password: password

  # Limits the number of lines to capture for each stack trace.
  # Default is 30
  max_stack_trace_lines: 30

  # Provides the ability to configure the attributes sent to New Relic. These
  # attributes can be found in transaction traces, traced errors, Insight's
  # transaction events, and Insight's page views.
  attributes:

    # When true, attributes will be sent to New Relic. The default is true.
    enabled: true

    #A comma separated list of attribute keys whose values should
    # be sent to New Relic.

  # Transaction tracer captures deep information about slow
  # transactions and sends this to the New Relic service once a
  # minute. Included in the transaction is the exact call sequence of
  # the transactions including any SQL statements issued.
  transaction_tracer:

    # Transaction tracer is enabled by default. Set this to false to turn it off.
    # This feature is not available to Lite accounts and is automatically disabled.
    # Default is true.
    enabled: true

    # Threshold in seconds for when to collect a transaction
    # trace. When the response time of a controller action exceeds
    # this threshold, a transaction trace will be recorded and sent to
    # New Relic. Valid values are any float value, or (default) "apdex_f",
    # which will use the threshold for the "Frustrated" Apdex level
    # (greater than four times the apdex_t value).
    # Default is apdex_f.
    transaction_threshold: apdex_f

    # When transaction tracer is on, SQL statements can optionally be
    # recorded. The recorder has three modes, "off" which sends no
    # SQL, "raw" which sends the SQL statement in its original form,
    # and "obfuscated", which strips out numeric and string literals.
    # Default is obfuscated.

    log_sql: false

    # Threshold in seconds for when to collect stack trace for a SQL
    # call. In other words, when SQL statements exceed this threshold,
    # then capture and send to New Relic the current stack trace. This is
    # helpful for pinpointing where long SQL calls originate from.
    # Default is 0.5 seconds.
    stack_trace_threshold: 0.5

    # Determines whether the agent will capture query plans for slow
    # SQL queries. Only supported for MySQL and PostgreSQL.
    # Default is true.

  # Error collector captures information about uncaught exceptions and
  # sends them to New Relic for viewing.
  error_collector:

    # This property enables the collection of errors. If the property is not
    # set or the property is set to false, then errors will not be collected.
    # Default is true.
    enabled: true

    # Use this property to exclude specific exceptions from being reported as errors
    # by providing a comma separated list of full class names.
    # The default is to exclude akka.actor.ActorKilledException. If you want to override
    # this, you must provide any new value as an empty list is ignored.
    ignore_errors: akka.actor.ActorKilledException

    # Use this property to exclude specific http status codes from being reported as errors
    # by providing a comma separated list of status codes.
    # The default is to exclude 404s. If you want to override
    # this, you must provide any new value as an empty list is ignored.
    ignore_status_codes: 404

  # Transaction Events are used for Histograms and Percentiles. Unaggregated data is collected
  # for each web transaction and sent to the server on harvest.
  transaction_events:

    # Set to false to disable transaction events.
    # Default is true.
    enabled: true

    # Events are collected up to the configured amount. Afterwards, events are sampled to
    # maintain an even distribution across the harvest cycle. Largest value accepted is 10000.
    # Default is 2000.  Setting to 0 will disable.
    max_samples_stored: 2000

  # Cross Application Tracing adds request and response headers to
  # external calls using supported HTTP libraries to provide better
  # performance data when calling applications monitored by other New Relic Agents.
  cross_application_tracer:

    # Set to false to disable cross application tracing.
    # Default is true.
    enabled: true

  # Thread profiler measures wall clock time, CPU time, and method call counts
  # in your application's threads as they run.
  # This feature is not available to Lite accounts and is automatically disabled.
  thread_profiler:

  # New Relic Real User Monitoring gives you insight into the performance real users are
  # experiencing with your website. This is accomplished by measuring the time it takes for
  # your users' browsers to download and render your web pages by injecting a small amount
  # of JavaScript code into the header and footer of each page.
  browser_monitoring:

    # By default the agent automatically inserts API calls in compiled JSPs to
    # inject the monitoring JavaScript into web pages. Not all rendering engines are supported.
    # See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/java/real-user-monitoring-in-java#manual_instrumentation

# Application Environments
# ------------------------------------------
# Environment specific settings are in this section.
# You can use the environment to override the default settings.
# For example, to change the app_name setting.
# Use -Dnewrelic.environment=<environment> on the Java startup command line
# to set the environment.
# The default environment is production.

# NOTE if your application has other named environments, you should
# provide configuration settings for these environments here.
