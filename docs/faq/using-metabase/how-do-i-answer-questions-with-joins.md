# How do I answer questions where I need to join tables together?

If you're using Metabase version 0.32 or earlier, you'll need to either write a SQL query that contains joins, or have your Metabase administrator set up foreign keys (they can read more about that [here][editing-metadata]).

If you are using Metabase 0.33 or above, you can [perform joins using the Notebook editor][notebook-editor-joins], but you should probably upgrade anyway.
