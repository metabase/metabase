## Hide the collection picker and hard code the collection you want people to save stuff to

With static questions, you set a specific collection as the collection people can save items to, so that they don't have bother picking a collection. To hard-code a collection:

1. Set `isSaveEnabled` to true.
2. Set `targetCollection` to the collection ID you want people to save items to.

For more options, see [Question props](./questions.md).
