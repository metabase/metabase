(ns metabase.util.urls
  "Utility functions for generating the frontend URLs that correspond various user-facing Metabase *objects*, like Cards or Dashboards.
   This is intended as the central place for all such URL-generation activity, so if frontend routes change, only this file need be changed
   on the backend.

   Functions for generating URLs not related to Metabase *objects* generally do not belong here, unless they are used in many places in the
   codebase; one-off URL-generation functions should go in the same namespaces or modules where they are used."
