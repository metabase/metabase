# Documents

{% include plans-blockquote.html feature="Documents" %}

Documents let you tell a story with your data by combining text, charts, and other content.

## Create a document

1. Click the **+ New** button in the top right.
2. Select **Document**.
3. Do stuff. 
4. Click the **Save** button.

## List commands with `/`

Type `/` in your document to see available commands:

- **Ask Metabot** to chat with [Metabot](../ai/metabot.md) in the document.
- **Chart** to insert a table or chart from an existing question or model. You can't add dashboards or other documents, but you can mention them (see the next section).
- **Link**. You can mention other items in your Metabase.

## Mention items with `@`

You can type `@` to mention items from your Metabase. (The mentions get a fancy little icon next to them).

## Add charts to documents

You can add [questions](../questions/start.md) and [models](../data-modeling/models.md) to a document.

### Adding a chart copies it to the document

When you add a chart from a collection, Metabase creates a copy in the document. The original question remains in the collection.

### Charts generated by Metabot only exist in the document

If Metabot generates a chart, Metabase saves that question to the document itself. If you delete it, it's gone forever. You won't be able to recover the question from the trash.

### Editing charts

To edit a chart, click the **three-dot** menu in the chart's upper right. You can:

- Edit visualization
- Edit query  
- Replace the chart with another question or model

Edits only affect the chart in the document. If you added the chart from a collection, Metabase will have created a copy of the chart. Any changes made to the chart in the document won't affect the original question.

## Formatting text

Documents support Markdown syntax for:

- Headings: `#`
- Images: Use `![Image text](image link)` or paste images directly into the document.
- Blockquotes: `> This is a blockquote`.
- Code blocks: Wrap with triple backticks (\`\`\`). Syntax highlighting isn't supported yet.

You can also access formatting options by typing `/`.

## Links

If you paste a link into a document, Metabase will turn it into a clickable link. For now, Markdown links aren't supported, and you can't change the link text.

## Commenting on documents

To comment on a document, click the chat bubble next to the section you want to comment on.

You can comment on whole sections like charts, headings, or text blocks. You can't highlight portions of text to comment on.

You can:

- React to comments with emojis (which are like pictures masquerading as words). For example, this is a gondola: ðŸš .
- Link to a comment. Click the **three-dot** menu and select **Copy link**.
- Resolve comments. Resolved comments appear in a separate tab.

### Deleting comments

If you never want to see a comment again:

1. Resolve the comment.
2. Find it in the Resolved tab.
3. Click on the **three-dot** menu.
4. Select **Delete**.

This deletion is permanent. You'll never see that comment again.

## Printing documents

To print a document, click on the **three-dot** menu and select **Print document**.

## When to use a document vs. a dashboard

Documents and dashboards both have their use cases.

### Prefer documents for exploration and narration

Documents work best for:

- Telling a story with data
- Point-in-time analysis
- Opening analysis for comments
- Exploratory analysis

### Use dashboards for tracking metrics

Dashboards work best for:

- Regular analysis. Numbers you want to keep an eye on every day, week, or month.
- Filtering results across multiple charts.
- More control over presentation.

## Document permissions

Whether someone can view or edit a document and its data depends on that person's collection and data permissions. See [Permissions](../permissions/introduction.md).
