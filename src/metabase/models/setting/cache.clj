;; CACHE SYNCHRONIZATION
;;
;; When running multiple Metabase instances (horizontal scaling), it is of course possible for one instance to update
;; a Setting, and, since Settings are cached (to avoid tons of DB calls), for the other instances to then have an
;; out-of-date cache. Thus we need a way for instances to know when their caches are out of date, so they can update
;; them accordingly. Here is our solution:
;;
;; We will record the last time *any* Setting was updated in a special Setting called `settings-last-updated`.
;;
;; Since `settings-last-updated` itself is a Setting, it will get fetched as part of each instance's local cache; we
;; can then periodically compare the locally cached value of `settings-last-updated` with the value in the DB. If our
;; locally cached value is older than the one in the DB, we will flush our cache. When the cache is fetched again, it
;; will have the up-to-date value.
;;
;; Because different machines can have out-of-sync clocks, we'll rely entirely on the application DB for caclulating
;; and comparing values of `settings-last-updated`. Because the Setting table itself only stores text values, we'll
;; need to cast it between TEXT and TIMESTAMP SQL types as needed.
