;; The following "defaults" are not applied to the settings themselves - why not? Because the existing behavior is
;; that, if you manually update the settings, queries are affected *WHETHER OR NOT* the
;; `add-default-userland-constraints` middleware was applied.
;;
;; To achieve this, the QP looks for the following, in order:
;; 1. a non-nil value set by the `add-default-userland-constraints` middleware below, either:
;;    a) the value of the setting (if it's set),
;;    b) the "default" value from the constant below, or
;;    c) `nil` if the constraint middleware was not applied
;; 2. a non-nil value for the appropriate setting (for aggregated vs. unaggregated queries) itself, either:
;;    a) the value of the setting, or
;;    b) `nil` if the setting is not set
;; 3. the value of `absolute-max-results`
;;
;;
;; If we turned the below `const`s into `:default`s on the settings themselves, we would use the default values for
;; all queries, whether or not the middleware was applied.
