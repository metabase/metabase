# Connecting to Data Warehouses

In the context of this document, a data warehouse is a database that Metabase will connect to and allow its users to ask questions against. It can either be a dedicated analytics database, a full fledged data warehouse, or just another applications database. 


## Database Drivers
Metabase can currently connect to the following types of data warehouses:

* H2
* MySQL
* PostgreSQL
* Mongo

On our roadmap are

* [Druid](http://www.github.com/metabase/metabase-init/issues/655)
* [Parse](http://www.github.com/metabase/metabase-init/issues/654) 
* [Redshift](http://www.github.com/metabase/metabase-init/issues/652)

If you are interested in the status of any of these drivers, click through to the issues to see what work is being done. If you are interested in a driver to another database, please open an issue!
