(mu/defn create-csv-upload!
  "Main entry point for CSV uploading.

  What it does:
  - throws an error if the user cannot upload to the given database and schema (see [[can-create-upload-error]] for reasons)
  - throws an error if the user has write permissions to the given collection
  - detects the schema of the CSV file
  - inserts the data into a new table with a unique name, along with an extra auto-generated primary key column
  - syncs and scans the table
  - creates a model which wraps the table

  Requires that current-user dynamic vars in [[metabase.api.common]] are bound as if by API middleware (this is
  needed for QP permissions checks).
  Returns the newly created model. May throw validation, permimissions, or DB errors.

  Args:
  - `collection-id`: the ID of the collection to create the model in. `nil` means the root collection.
  - `filename`: the name of the file being uploaded.
  - `file`: the file being uploaded.
  - `db-id`: the ID of the database to upload to.
  - `schema-name`: the name of the schema to create the table in (optional).
  - `table-prefix`: the prefix to use for the table name (optional)."
