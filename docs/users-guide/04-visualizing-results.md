##Visualizing results
---
While tables are useful for looking up information or finding specific numbers, it's usually easier to see trends and make sense of data overall using graphs.

Answers to questions can be visualized in a number of ways:

* Number
* Table
* Line
* Bar
* Pie
* Area
* Maps 
   * United States Map - Creating a map of the United States from your database requires your results to contain a column field with states.  GeoJSON is the default output format.  
   * Country Map - To visualize your results in the format of a country map, your result must contain a column that is a country.  The default output format is GeoJSON.  
   * Pin Map - To generate a pin map, your account administrator to configure a Google Maps API key and for your data set to contain a marked latitude and longitude column.    

To change how the answer to your query is displayed, click on the visualization button beneath the query interface bar to access the dropdown menu.

If a particular output format is not sensible for your query, the format option will appear faded on the dropdown menu.  
 
Once a question is answered, you can save, favorite, or download the answer.
