## About the Metabase API

- **The API is subject to change.** We rarely change API endpoints, and almost never remove them, but if you write code that relies on the API, there's a chance you might have to update your code in the future.
- **The API isn't versioned.** So don’t expect to stay on a particular version of Metabase in order to use a “stable” API.
