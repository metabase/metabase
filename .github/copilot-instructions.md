### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **State**: Redux Toolkit
- **Styling**: CSS Modules (preferred) > Emotion styled-components
- **UI**: `metabase/ui` components built with Mantine v8
- **Build**: Rspack (primary), Webpack (legacy)
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library, Cypress

### Coding Standards

#### Component Preferences

- Prefer `metabase/ui`components over `metabase/common/components`
- Use `.tsx` for components, `.ts` for utilities

#### Styling

ALWAYS prefer Mantine style props,then CSS modules. DO NOT suggest styled components, they are deprecated.

#### TypeScript Migration

When heavily editing `.js`/`.jsx` files, create a separate PR to convert to TypeScript first, then implement changes.

#### Enterprise Features

Enterprise functionality MUST use the plugin system. It is very important to not expose enterprise code in the OSS version.

#### Testing Requirements

All PRs should include tests. Prefer Unit tests over E2E tests.

#### Localization

All user-facing strings MUST be localized using the ttag library. Localized strings should be complete phrases, do not concatenate a few separately localized strings. You should add context to strings where the meaning of the string might not be obvious in isolation: e.g. "Home" might have different words in some languages depending on whether you're talking about a dwelling or the landing page for a website.
