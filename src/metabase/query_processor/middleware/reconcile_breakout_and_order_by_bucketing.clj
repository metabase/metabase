  "SQL places restrictions when using a `GROUP BY` clause (MBQL `:breakout`) in combination with an `ORDER BY`
  clause (MBQL `:order-by`) -- columns that appear in the `ORDER BY` must appear in the `GROUP BY`. When we apply
  datetime or binning bucketing in a breakout, for example `cast(x AS DATE)` (MBQL `:datetime-field` clause), we need
  to apply the same bucketing to instances of that Field in the `order-by` clause. In other words:

  Bad:

    SELECT count(*)
    FROM table
    GROUP BY CAST(x AS date)
    ORDER BY x ASC

  (MBQL)

     {:source-table 1
      :breakout     [[:datetime-field [:field-id 1] :day]]
      :order-by     [[:asc [:field-id 1]]]}

  Good:

    SELECT count(*)
    FROM table
    GROUP BY CAST(x AS date)
    ORDER BY CAST(x AS date) ASC

  (MBQL)

    {:source-table 1
     :breakout     [[:datetime-field [:field-id 1] :day]]
     :order-by     [[:asc [:datetime-field [:field-id 1] :day]]]}

  The frontend, on the rare occasion it generates a query that explicitly specifies an `order-by` clause, usually will
  generate one that directly corresponds to the bad example above. This middleware finds these cases and rewrites the
  query to look like the good example."
