  "Settings are a fast and simple way to create a setting that can be set from the admin page. They are saved to the
  application Database, but intelligently cached internally for super-fast lookups.

  Define a new Setting with [[defsetting]] (optionally supplying things like default value, type, or custom getters &
  setters):

    (defsetting mandrill-api-key \"API key for Mandrill\")

  The newly-defined Setting will automatically be made available to the frontend client depending on its [[Visibility]].

  You can also set the value via the corresponding env var, which looks like `MB_MANDRILL_API_KEY`, where the name of
  the Setting is converted to uppercase and dashes to underscores.

  The var created with [[defsetting]] can be used as a getter/setter, or you can use [[get]] and [[set!]]:

    (require '[metabase.models.setting :as setting])

    (setting/get :mandrill-api-key) ; only returns values set explicitly from the Admin Panel
    (mandrill-api-key)              ; returns value set in the Admin Panel, OR value of corresponding env var,
                                    ; OR the default value, if any (in that order)

    (setting/set! :mandrill-api-key \"NEW_KEY\")
    (mandrill-api-key! \"NEW_KEY\")

    (setting/set! :mandrill-api-key nil)
    (mandrill-api-key! nil)

  You can define additional Settings types adding implementations of [[default-tag-for-type]], [[get-value-of-type]],
  and [[set-value-of-type!]].

  [[writable-settings]] and [[user-readable-values-map]] can be used to fetch *all* Admin-writable and
  User-readable Settings, respectively. See their docstrings for more information.

  ### User-local and Database-local Settings

  Starting in 0.42.0, some Settings are allowed to have Database-specific values that override the normal site-wide
  value. Similarly, starting in 0.43.0, some Settings are allowed to have User-specific values. These are similar in
  concept to buffer-local variables in Emacs Lisp.

  When a Setting is allowed to be User or Database local, any values in [[*user-local-values*]] or
  [[*database-local-values*]] for that Setting will be returned preferentially to site-wide values of that Setting.
  [[*user-local-values*]] comes from the `User.settings` column in the application DB, and [[*database-local-values*]]
  comes from the `Database.settings` column. `nil` values in [[*user-local-values*]] and [[*database-local-values*]]
  are ignored, i.e. you cannot 'unset' a site-wide value with a User- or Database-local one.

  Whether or not a Setting can be User- or Database-local is controlled by the `:user-local` and `:database-local`
  options passed to [[defsetting]]. A Setting can only be User-local *or* Database-local, not both; this is enforced
  when the Setting is defined. There are three valid values of these options:

  * `:only` means this Setting can *only* have a User- or Database-local value and cannot have a 'normal' site-wide
  value. It cannot be set via env var. Default values are still allowed for User- and Database-local-only Settings.
  Database-local-only Settings are never returned by [[writable-settings]] or [[user-readable-values-map]] regardless of
  their [[Visibility]].

  * `:allowed` means this Setting can be User- or Database-local and can also have a normal site-wide value; if both
  are specified, the User- or Database-specific value will be returned preferentially when we are in the context of a
  specific User or Database (i.e., [[*user-local-values*]] or [[*database-local-values*]] is bound).

  * `:never` means User- or Database-specific values cannot be set for this Setting. Values in [[*user-local-values*]]
  and [[*database-local-values*]] will be ignored.

  `:never` is the default value of both `:user-local` and `:database-local`; to allow User- or Database-local values,
  the Setting definition must explicitly specify `:only` or `:allowed` for the appropriate option.

  If a User-local setting is written in the context of an API request (i.e., when [[metabase.api.common/*current-user*]]
  is bound), the value will be local to the current user. If it is written outside of an API request, a site-wide
  value will be written. (At the time of this writing, there is not yet a FE-client-friendly way to set Database-local
  values. Just set them manually in the application DB until we figure that out.)

  Custom setter functions do not affect User- or Database-local values; they always set the site-wide value.

  See #14055 and #19399 for more information about and motivation behind User- and Database-local Settings."

    (mandrill-api-key! new-value) ; update the value
    (mandrill-api-key! nil)       ; delete the value

  A setting can be set from the Admin Panel or via the corresponding env var, eg. `MB_MANDRILL_API_KEY` for the
  example above.

  You may optionally pass any of the `options` below:

  ###### `:default`

  The default value of the setting. This must be of the same type as the Setting type, e.g. the default for an
  `:integer` setting must be some sort of integer. (default: `nil`)

  ###### `:type`

  `:string` (default) or one of the other types that implement [[get-value-of-type]] and [[set-value-of-type]].
  Non-`:string` Settings have special default getters and setters that automatically coerce values to the correct
  types.

  ###### `:visibility`

  Controls where this setting is visibile, and who can update it. Possible values are:

    Visibility       | Who Can See It?              | Who Can Update It?
    ---------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------
    :public          | The entire world             | Admins and Settings Managers
    :authenticated   | Logged-in Users              | Admins and Settings Managers
    :settings-manager| Admins and Settings Managers | Admins and Settings Managers
    :admin           | Admins                       | Admins
    :internal        | Nobody                       | No one (usually for env-var-only settings)

  'Settings Managers' are non-admin users with the 'settings' permission, which gives them access to the Settings page
  in the Admin Panel.

  ###### `:getter`

  A custom getter fn, which takes no arguments. Overrides the default implementation. (This can in turn call functions
  in this namespace like methods of [[get-value-of-type]] to invoke the 'parent' getter behavior.)

  ###### `:setter`

  A custom setter fn, which takes a single argument, or `:none` for read-only settings. Overrides the default
  implementation. (This can in turn call methods of [[set-value-of-type!]] to invoke 'parent' setter behavior. Keep in
  mind that the custom setter may be passed `nil`, which should clear the values of the Setting.)

  ###### `:cache?`

  Should this Setting be cached? (default `true`)? Be careful when disabling this, because it could have a very
  negative performance impact.

  ###### `:sensitive?`

  Is this a sensitive setting, such as a password, that we should never return in plaintext? (Default: `false`).
  Obfuscation is not done by getter functions, but instead by functions that ultimately return these values via the
  API, such as [[writable-settings]] below. (In other words, code in the backend can continute to consume
  sensitive Settings normally; sensitivity is a purely user-facing option.)

  ###### `:database-local`

  The ability of this Setting to be /Database-local/. Valid values are `:only`, `:allowed`, and `:never`. Default:
  `:never`. See docstring for [[metabase.models.setting]] for more information.

  ###### `:user-local`

  Whether this Setting is /User-local/. Valid values are `:only`, `:allowed`, and `:never`. Default: `:never`. See
  docstring for [[metabase.models.setting]] for more info.

  ###### `:deprecated`

  If this setting is deprecated, this should contain a string of the Metabase version in which the setting was
  deprecated. A deprecation notice will be logged whenever the setting is written. (Default: `nil`).

  ###### `:on-change`

  Do you want to update something else when this setting changes? Takes a function which takes 2 arguments, `old`, and
  `new` and calls it with the old and new settings values. By default, the :on-change will be missing, and nothing
  will happen, in [[call-on-change]] below.

  ###### `:feature`
  If non-nil, determines the Enterprise feature flag required to use this setting. If the feature is not enabled,
  the setting will behave the same as if `enabled?` returns `false` (see below).

  ###### `enabled?`
  Function which returns true if the setting should be enabled. If it returns false, the setting will throw an
  exception when it is attempted to be set, and will return its default value when read. Defaults to always enabled."
