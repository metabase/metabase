(ns metabase.task.send-pulses
  "Tasks related to running `Pulses`.

  There are 2 main jobs here:

  1. `SendPulse` - in which it'll send a pulse to all channels that are scheduled to run at the same time.
    For example if you have an Alert that has scheduled to send to both slack and emails at 6am, this job will be triggered
    and send the pulse to both channels.

  2. `RePrioritizeSendPulses` - is the coordinator job that has 2 responsibilities:
    - Update the priority of SendPulse jobs that are scheduled at the same time so that fast pulses are executed first.
    - Delete PulseChannels that don't have any recipients."
