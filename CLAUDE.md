# Metabase Development Guide

## Autonomous Development Workflow

- Do not attempt to read or edit files outside the project folder
- Add failing tests first, then fix them
- Work autonomously in small, testable increments
- Run targeted tests, and lint continuously during development
- Prioritize understanding existing patterns before implementing
- Don't commit changes, leave it for the user to review and make commits

## Quick Commands

### JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Lint:** `yarn lint-eslint`
- **Test:** `yarn test-unit path/to/file.unit.spec.js` or `yarn test-unit -t "pattern"`
- **Watch:** `yarn test-unit-watch path/to/file.unit.spec.js`
- **Format:** `yarn prettier`
- **Type Check:** `yarn type-check`

### Clojure
- **Lint PR:** `./bin/mage kondo-updated master` (or whatever target branch)
  - Call the command one time at the beginning, record the results, then work through the problems one by one.
  - If the solution is obvious, then please apply the fix. Otherwise skip it.
  - If you fix all the issues (and verify by rerunning the kondo-updated command), commit the change with a succinct
    and descriptive commit message.
- **Lint File:** `./bin/mage kondo <file or files>` (or whatever target branch)
  - Use the linter as a way to know that you are adhering to conventions in place in the codebase
- **Lint Changes:** `./bin/mage kondo-updated HEAD^`
- **Format:** `./bin/mage cljfmt-files [path]`
- **Test file:** `clojure -X:dev:test :only namespace/test-name`
- **Check Indentation** `./bin/mage -balance-parens-check` with optional line-number
- **Eval Clojure Code** `./bin/mage -eval '<code>'`
  - See `Sending code to the REPL` for more details

### ClojureScript
- **Test:** `yarn test-cljs`

## Clojure REPL-driven development

- Start with small, fundamental functions:
- Identify the core features or functionalities required for your task.
- Break each feature down into the smallest, most basic functions that can be developed and tested independently.
- Write and test in the REPL:
  - Write the code for each small function directly in the REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).
  - Test it thoroughly with a variety of inputs, including typical use cases and relevant edge cases, to ensure it
    behaves as expected.
- Integrate into source code:
  - Once a function works correctly in the REPL, move it from the REPL environment into your source code files (e.g.,
    within appropriate namespaces).
- Gradually increase complexity:
  - Build upon tested, basic functions to create more complex functions or components.
  - Compose smaller functions together, testing each new composition in the REPL to verify correctness step by step.
- Ensure dependency testing:
  - Make sure every function is fully tested in the REPL before it is depended upon by other functions.
  - This ensures that each layer of your application is reliable before you build on it.
- Leverage the REPL fully:
  - Use the REPL as your primary tool to experiment with different approaches, iterate quickly, and get immediate
    feedback on your code.
- Follow functional programming principles:
  - Keep functions small, focused, and composable.
  - Leverage Clojure's functional programming features—like immutability, higher-order functions, and the standard
    library—to write concise, effective code.

### How to evaluate code

#### Keeping parens balanced
- Edit clojure files one step at a time.
- After every change to a clojure form, call `mage -balance-parens-check thefile.clj <line-number>`.
- If the change results in unbalanced parens, try again until it is balanced.

So if you change this file (line numbers on the left) in `yourfile.clj`:

```
11| +(defn square [x]
12| -  (* x))
12| +  (* x x))
```

After EVERY change: call `mage -balance-parens-check yourfile.clj 12`, which checks if the entire square function is balanced. Always pay close attention to the results: Unbalanced Code Is Unacceptable!

You can also call `mage -balance-parens-check yourfile.clj` without the line number to check the entire file.

#### Bottom-up dev loop:
1. Write code into a file
2. Evaluate the file's namespace and make sure it loads correctly
3. Call functions in the namespace with test inputs, and observe that the outputs are correct 3.1 Feel free to copy
   these REPL session trials into actual test cases using `deftest` and `is`.
4. Once you know these functions are good, return to 1, and compose them into the task that you need to build.

#### Sending code to the REPL:
- Send code to the metabase process REPL using: `./bin/mage -eval '(+ 1 1)'` where `(+ 1 1)` is your Clojure code.
  - This will evaluate it in the user namespace.
  - If the Metabase backend is not running, you'll see an error message with instructions on how to start it. The
    error will tell you whether the REPL server is missing or if there's nothing listening on the port.

##### Working with files and namespaces:

The simplest and most reliable way to work with your code is:

1. **Load a file and call functions with fully qualified names**:
   ```
   ./bin/mage -eval '(load-file "path/to/your/file.clj") (your.namespace/your-function arg1 arg2)'
   ```
   
   Example:
   ```
   ./bin/mage -eval '(load-file "dev/src/dev/nocommit/eight_queens.clj") (dev.nocommit.eight-queens/solve-n-queens 4)'
   ```

##### Understanding the response:

The `./bin/mage -eval` command returns three separate, independent outputs:
- `value`: The return value of the last expression (best for data structures)
- `stdout`: Any printed output from `println` etc. (best for messages)
- `stderr`: Any error messages (best for warnings and errors)

Example call:
``` bash
./bin/mage -eval '(println "Hello, world!") '\''({0 1, 1 3, 2 0, 3 2} {0 2, 1 0, 2 3, 3 1})'
```

Example response:
```
ns: user
session: 32a35206-871c-4553-9bc9-f49491173d1c
value:  ({0 1, 1 3, 2 0, 3 2} {0 2, 1 0, 2 3, 3 1})
stdout:  Hello, world!
stderr:
```

For effective REPL usage:
- Return data structures as function return values
- Use `println` for human-readable messages
- Let errors propagate naturally to stderr


## Tips

- End all files with a newline.
- When editing tabular code, where the columns line up, try to keep them aligned.
- When you see misaligned code elements (like a `goal-met?` function on line 290 that should align with one on line 289), make sure to align them properly.
