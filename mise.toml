# Metabase Development Environment
# =================================
#
# This file defines the tools required for Metabase development.
# We use mise (https://mise.jdx.dev) to manage tool versions consistently
# across all development machines.
#
# Getting started:
#   1. Install mise: https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html
#   2. Run: mise trust && mise install
#   3. Run: ./bin/dev-bootstrap
#
# mise will automatically activate the correct versions when you cd into this directory.

[env]
# Disable corepack - we use yarn classic installed via mise
COREPACK_ENABLE_AUTO_PIN = "0"

# =============================================================================
# Required Tools
# =============================================================================

[tools]
# Node.js - for frontend development
# We pin to a specific version to ensure consistency across the team.
# This should match .nvmrc for compatibility with other version managers.
node = "22.13.1"

# Yarn Classic - for package management
# IMPORTANT: Metabase requires Yarn 1.x (Classic), NOT Yarn 2+ (Berry)
# Do not use corepack; mise manages yarn directly.
yarn = "1.22.22"

# Java - for Clojure backend
# We require Eclipse Temurin (AdoptOpenJDK successor) for consistency.
# The prefix ensures we get Temurin specifically, not just any OpenJDK.
java = "temurin-21.0.9+10.0.LTS"

# Clojure CLI - for backend development and REPL
clojure = "1.12.3.1577"

# Babashka - for mage task automation and scripting
babashka = "1.12.212"
