(ns metabase.xrays.automagic-dashboards.combination
  "Generate \"interesting\" combinations of metrics, dimensions, and filters.

  In the `metabase.xrays.automagic-dashboards.interesting` namespace, we create \"grounded\" metrics, which are both realized
  (field references have been added to their aggregate clauses) and interesting (because metrics are always
  interesting), as well as grounded dimensions and filters. This ns combines these dimensions (as breakouts) and filters
  (as filters) into the ground metrics based on the affinities defined in provided card-templates.

  Card templates provided the following key relationships:
  - dimension to dimension affinities - The groups of dimensions the might appear on the x-axis of a chart (breakouts).
    These generally a single dimension (e.g. time or category) but can be multiple (e.g. longitude and latitude)
  - dimension to metric affinities - Combinations of dimensions and metrics (e.g. profit metric over time dimension).
    This functionally adds breakouts to a metric.
  - metric to metric affinities - Combinations of metrics that belong together (e.g. Sum, Avg, Max, and Min of a field).

  The primary function in this ns, `grounded-metrics->dashcards` takes the base context , above grounded values, and
  card definitions and creates a set of dashcards with the above combinations of metrics, dimensions, and filters."
