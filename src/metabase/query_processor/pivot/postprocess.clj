;; I'll do my best to concisely explain what's happening here. Some terms:
;;  - raw pivot rows -> the rows returned by the above 'pivot query processor machinery'.
;;  - pivot-cols/pivot-rows -> vectors of indices into the raw pivot rows where the final pivot row/col values come from
;;    the values from these indices are what make up the header row and header column labels
;;  - pivot-measures -> vector of indices into raw pivot rows where the aggregated value comes from. This
;;    the values from these indices (often just 1 idx) are what end up in the table's 'cells' (the stuff making up the bulk of the table)

;; an example of what a raw pivot row might look like, with header shown for clarity:
;; {:Cat A "AA", :Cat B "BA", :Cat C "CA", :Cat D "DA", :pivot-grouping 0, :Sum of Measure 1}
;; [Cat A Cat B Cat C Cat D pivot-grouping Sum of Measure]
;; [ "AA"  "BA"  "CA"  "DA"              0              1]
