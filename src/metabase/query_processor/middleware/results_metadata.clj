   is valid and hasn't been accidentally tampered with.

   By default, this is not cryptographically secure, nor is it meant to be. Of course, a bad actor could alter the
   metadata and return a new, correct checksum. But intentionally saving bad metadata would only help in letting you
   write bad queries; the field literals can only refer to columns in the original 'source' query at any rate, so you
   wouldn't, for example, be able to give yourself access to columns in a different table.
