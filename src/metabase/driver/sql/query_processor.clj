  - `2`: Use [[honey.sql/format]] (Honey SQL 2) to compile a Honey SQL map to `[sql & args]`

  SQL 2, and common code such as [[metabase.driver.sql.query-processor]] has been updated to support either
  compilation target.

  This method exists primarily to give third-party driver authors a window to migrate their own code to Honey SQL 2.
  Before 49 ships, implement this method and return `2` and make sure things still work, as Honey SQL 1 support will

(defn- throw-double-compilation-error
  "[[->honeysql]] shouldn't be getting called on something that is already Honey SQL. Prior to 46/Honey SQL 2, this
  would not usually cause problems because we could easily distinguish between MBQL clauses and Honey SQL record
  types; with Honey SQL 2, clauses are basically indistinguishable from MBQL, and some things exist in both, like `:/`
  and `:ceil`; it's more important that we be careful about avoiding double-compilation to prevent bugs or redundant
  expressions.

  The exception to this rule is [[h2x/identifier]] -- for historical reasons, drivers were encouraged to do this in
  the past and some rely on this behavior (see ;;; [[metabase.driver.bigquery-cloud-sdk.query-processor]]
  and [[metabase.driver.snowflake]] for example). Maybe we come up with some better way to handle this -- e.g. maybe
  [[h2x/identifier]] should be replaced with a `sql.qp` multimethod so driver-specific behavior can happen as we
  generate Honey SQL, not afterwards.

  If you see this warning, it usually means you are passing a Honey SQL form to a method that expects an MBQL form,
  usually [[->honeysql]]; this probably means you're recursively calling [[->honeysql]] when you should not be.

  You can use [[compiled]] to prevent this error, to work around situations where you need to compile something to

  "Wrap an expression for a `:select` clause or similar as `[expr]` for Honey SQL 2. For Honey SQL 1, return it as-is.

  Honey SQL 2 generally needs things to be wrapped even if you don't specify an alias, so vector expressions like
  `[::f :x]` are not interpreted as `[expr alias]`. Honey SQL 1 explicitly disallows this, however.

  Honey SQL 1:

    {:select [(hsql/call :f :x)]}      => SELECT f(x)
    {:select [[(hsql/call :f :x)]]}    => Error: Alias should have two parts
    {:select [[(hsql/call :f :x) :a]]} => SELECT f(x) AS a

  Honey SQL 2:

    {:select [[:f :x]}      => SELECT f AS x (WRONG!)
    {:select [[[:f :x]]}    => SELECT f(x)
    {:select [[[:f x] :a]]} => SELECT f(x) AS a"

  HoneySQL representation of on `AS` clause is a tuple like `[<form> <alias>]`.

  In some cases where the alias would be redundant, such as plain field literals, this returns the form as-is for
  Honey SQL 1. It's wrapped in a vector for Honey SQL 2 to eliminate ambiguity if the clause compiles to a Honey SQL
  vector. This is not allowed in Honey SQL 1 -- `[expr alias]` always has to have an alias.

  Honey SQL 2 seems to actually need an additional vector around the `alias` form, otherwise it doesn't work
  correctly. See https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/C1Q164V29/p1675301408026759
