# Troubleshooting database connections

If you can't connect to your database, you'll need to figure out if the problem is happening with Metabase or your database server.

If your database connection is successful, but the tables aren't showing up in the [Data Browser](https://www.metabase.com/learn/getting-started/data-browser), go to [Troubleshooting missing tables](./cant-see-tables.md).

## Troubleshooting connections to Metabase

1. Go to **Admin** > **Databases** and select your database to confirm that your connection hasn’t been changed or deleted.

    - If Metabase hasn't started syncing with your database, click **Sync database schema now**.

    - If Metabase is taking a long time to sync, go to [Troubleshooting syncs and scans](./sync-fingerprint-scan.md).

2. Go to **Admin** > **Troubleshooting** > **Logs** to check if Metabase failed to sync [due to an error](#common-database-connection-errors).

    - If the logs feel overwhelming, check out [How to read the server logs](./server-logs.md).

If you don't have access to the Metabase Admin panel, you'll need to ask the person who set up your Metabase.

## Troubleshooting connections to the database server

1. [Check that the data warehouse server is running](#checking-the-server-status).

2. Check if you can connect to the data warehouse from another client using the machine that you’re running Metabase on.

    - If you can access the server from a bastion host or another machine, [check if your Metabase's IP address has access to your database server](#checking-your-server-access).

    - If you're running Metabase Cloud, check that you've [whitelisted our IP addresses](https://www.metabase.com/cloud/docs/ip-addresses-to-whitelist).

3. Make sure that Metabase is using a role with the necessary privileges to connect to your data warehouse. See [Granting database privileges](../databases/users-roles-privileges.md).

The steps above will help you detect whether the problem is occurring outside of Metabase. To _fix_ problems with your database server, you'll need to refer to the docs for your database or cloud service. Remember to [test your database connection](#testing-the-connection-status) after you make changes.

If you don't have access to the data warehouse server, you’ll need to ask the person who manages your database or data warehouse.

## Common database connection errors

### Your question took too long

If you see this error message in the Metabase interface, go to [Troubleshooting timeouts](./timeout.md).

### Connections cannot be acquired from the underlying database

If you see this error messages in the [logs](./server-logs.md) (**Admin** > **Troubleshooting** > **Logs**):

1. Go to **Admin** > **Databases** and select your database.
2. Go to **Advanced options** > **Additional JDBC connection string options** and add `trustServerCertificate=true`.
3. Click **Save**.

The version of Metabase you're using to connect to your data warehouse must support your database's version. For example, Metabase versions older than 46 lack support for Microsoft SQL Server 2022.

## Testing a database connection

As you work through the troubleshooting steps in this guide, you can check if each component is working as expected:

- [Server status](#checking-the-server-status)
- [Server access](#checking-your-server-access)
- [Connection status](#testing-the-connection-status)

### Checking the server status

If you’re using a hosted database service, go to the console and verify its status.

If you have direct access to a command-line interface, log in and make sure that your database is running and accepting queries.

### Checking your server access

To verify that your Metabase's IP address can access the database server:

1. Use the [netcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat) command  `nc` (or your operating system’s equivalent) to check if you can connect to the host on a given port. Note that different databases use different ports by default.

2. If you're running Metabase Cloud, check that you've [whitelisted our IP addresses](https://www.metabase.com/cloud/docs/ip-addresses-to-whitelist).

3. Check that your database credentials are correct.

#### Example commands

To verify the port used in a default PostgreSQL configuration (which listens on port 5432):

```
nc -v your-db-host 5432
```

To verify your credentials for a PostgreSQL database (you'll see an error if the database name or the user/password are incorrect):

```
psql -h HOSTNAME -p PORT -d DATABASENAME -U DATABASEUSER
```
### Testing the connection status

1. Go to the Metabase [SQL editor](../questions/native-editor/writing-sql.md).
2. Test the connection to your database by running:
    ```
    SELECT 1
    ```
