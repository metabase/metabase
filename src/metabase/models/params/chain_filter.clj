  "Generate and run an MBQL query to return possible values of a given Field based on the values of other related
  Fields.

  ## Remapping

  The main Field for which we search for values can optionally be remapped. ADDITIONAL CONSTRAINTS DO NOT SUPPORT
  REMAPPING! There are three types of remapping:

  1. Human-readable values remapping where you go assign string values to things like enum integers

  2. Implicit PK Field-> [Name] Field remapping. This happens automatically for any Field with `:type/PK` semantic type
  that has another Field with `:type/Name` semantic type in the same Table. e.g. `venue.id` is automatically
  remapped (displayed) as `venue.name`.

  3. Explicit FK Field->Field remapping. FK Fields can be manually remapped to a Field in the Table they point to.
  e.g. `venue.category_id` -> `category.name`. This is done by creating a `Dimension` for the Field in question with a
  `human_readable_field_id`. There is a big explanation of how this works in
  `metabase.query-processor.middleware.add-dimension-projections` -- see that namespace for more details.

  Here's some examples of what this namespace does. Suppose you do

    ;; find values of Field 1 starting with 'Cam' that are possible when Field 2 = \"abc\"
    (chain-filter-search 1 {2 \"abc\"} \"Cam\")

  Depending on the remapping situation, one of four things happens.

  ### A) Human-readable values remapping

  If Field 1 has human-readable values, we find those values that contain the string 'Cam' and then generate a query to
  restrict results to the matching original values. e.g. if Field 1 is \"venue.category_id\" and is
  human-readable-remapped with something like

    {1 \"Mexican\", 2 \"Camping Food\", 3 \"Campbell's Soup\"}

  and you do the search above, then we generate a query that looks something like:

    SELECT category_id
    FROM venue
    WHERE id IN (2, 3)
    AND field_2 = \"abc\"

  (we then convert these values back to [value human-readable-value] pairs in Clojure-land)

  ### B) Field->Field remapping (either type)

  Suppose Field 1 is `venue.category_id` which has a remapping \"name\" Field `category.name`. For the example search
  above, the resulting query looks something like:

    SELECT venue.category_id, category.name
    FROM venue
    LEFT JOIN category ON venue.category_id = category.id
    WHERE lower(category.name) LIKE 'cam%'
      AND field_2 = \"abc\"

  ### C) No remappings

  Life is easy. Suppose Field 1 is `category.name`. The resulting query is something like:

  SELECT name
  FROM category
  WHERE lower(name) LIKE '%cam'
  AND field_2 = \"abc\""
