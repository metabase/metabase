(ns metabase.native-query-analyzer
  "Integration with Macaw, which parses native SQL queries. All SQL-specific logic is in Macaw, the purpose of this
  namespace is to:

  1. Translate Metabase-isms into generic SQL that Macaw can understand.
  2. Encapsulate Metabase-specific business logic.

  The primary way of interacting with parsed queries is through their associated QueryFields (see model
  file). QueryFields are maintained through the `update-query-fields-for-card!` function. This is invoked as part of
  the lifecycle of a card (see the Card model).

  Query rewriting happens with the `replace-names` function."
