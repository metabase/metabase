# Troubleshooting viewing and editing questions and dashboards

## I can't view or edit a dashboard in a collection that I have permissions to

1. Check the collections where each question (or card) on the dashboard is saved.
2. If a saved question is in a collection that you don't have access to, you'll need to ask someone with edit access to the collection to:
    - Grant you permission to the collection.
    - Or, to move the saved question to a collection that you have permissions to.
3. If the steps above don't solve your problem, ask your Metabase admin if you have [permission to the database that's used by the question][block-access].

**Explanation**

Moving a dashboard to a different collection doesn't move the dashboard's questions into that collection. 

If the saved questions are stored in a restricted collection (such as someone's personal folder), then other groups won't be able to view those cards.

Someone with edit permissions (your Metabase admin is probably a safe bet) will need to move those questions into a collection that you have permissions to.

## Do you have a different problem?

- [I'm getting a "permission denied" error message][permission-denied].
- [I can't save my question or dashboard][proxies].
- [I can't see my tables][cant-see-tables].
