  "Defines several helper functions and multimethods for the serialization system.
  Serialization is an enterprise feature, but in the interest of keeping all the code for an entity in one place, these
  methods are defined here and implemented for all the exported models.

  Whether to export a new model:
  - Generally, the high-profile user facing things (databases, questions, dashboards, snippets, etc.) are exported.
  - Internal or automatic things (users, activity logs, permissions) are not.

  If the model is not exported, add it to the exclusion lists in the tests. Every model should be explicitly listed as

;;; The Clojure maps from extraction and ingestion always include a special key `:serdes/meta` giving some information
;;; about the serialized entity. The value is always a vector of maps that give a "path" to the entity. This is not a
;;; filesystem path; rather it defines the nesting of some entities inside others.
;;;
;;; Most paths are a single layer:
;;; `[{:model "ModelName" :id "entity ID or identity hash string" :label "Human-readable name"}]`
;;; `:model` and `:id` are required; `:label` is optional.
;;;
;;; But for some entities, it can be deeper. For example Fields belong to Tables, which are in Schemas (which don't
;;; really exist in appdb, but are reflected here for namespacing of table names), which are in Databases:
;;; `[{:model "Database" :id "my_db"}
;;;   {:model "Schema"   :id "PUBLIC"}
;;;   {:model "Table"    :id "Users"}
;;;   {:model "Field"    :id "email"}]`
;;;
;;; Many of the multimethods are keyed on the `:model` field of the leaf entry (the last).

(defmulti serdes-entity-id

(defmulti serdes-generate-path
  "Given the model name and raw entity from the database, returns a vector giving its *path*.
  `(serdes-generate-path \"ModelName\" entity)`

  The path is a vector of maps, root first and this entity itself last. Each map looks like:
  `{:model \"ModelName\" :id \"entity ID, identity hash, or custom ID\" :label \"optional human label\"}`

  Some entities stand alone, while some are naturally nested inside others. For example, fields belong in tables, which
  belong in databases. Further, since these use eg. column names as entity IDs, they can collide if all the fields get
  poured into one namespace (like a directory of YAML files).

  Finally, it's often useful to delete the databases from an export, since the receiving end has its own different, but
  compatible, database definitions. (For example, staging and prod instances of Metabase.) It's convenient for human
  understanding and editing to group fields under tables under databases.

  Therefore we provide an abstract path on the entities, which will generally be stored in a directory tree.
  (This is not strictly required - for a different medium like protobufs the path might be encoded some other way.)

  The path is reconstructed by ingestion and used as the key to read entities with `ingest-one`, and to match
  against existing entities.

  The default implementation is a single level, using the model name provided and the ID from either
  [[serdes-entity-id]] or [[serdes.hash/identity-hash]].

  Implementation notes:
  - `:serdes/meta` might be defined - if so it's coming from ingestion and might have truncated values in it, and should
    be reconstructed from the rest of the data.
  - The primary key might still be attached, during extraction.
  - `:label` is optional

;;; Serialization happens in two stages: extraction and storage. These are independent and deliberately decoupled.
;;; The result of extraction is a reducible stream of Clojure maps with `:serdes/meta` keys on them (see above).
;;; In particular, extraction does not care about file formats or other such things.
;;;
;;; Storage takes the stream from extraction and actually stores it or sends it. Traditionally we have serialized to a
;;; directory tree full of YAML files, and that's the only storage approach implemented here. But since the process is
;;; decoupled, we or a user could write their own storage layer, using JSON or protocol buffers or any other format.
;;;
;;; Both extraction and storage are written as a set of multimethods, with defaults for the common path.
;;; Note that extraction is controlled by a map of options and settings, detailed below.
;;;
;;; Extraction:
;;; - Top-level serialization code [[metabase-enterprise.serialization.v2.extract/extract-metabase]] has a list of
;;;   models to be exported.
;;;     - A test enforces that all models are either exported, or explicitly excluded, so new ones can't be forgotten.
;;; - It calls `(extract-all "ModelName" opts)` for each model.
;;;     - The default for this calls `(extract-query "ModelName" opts)`, getting back a reducible stream of entities.
;;;     - For each entity in that stream, it calls `(extract-one "ModelName" entity)`, which converts the map from the
;;;       database to a portable map with `:serdes/meta` on it. Eg. no database IDs as foreign keys.
;;; - The default [[extract-all]] should work for most models (overrride [[extract-query]] and [[extract-one]] instead),
;;;   but it can be overridden if needed.
;;;
;;; The end result of extraction is a reducible stream of Clojure maps; this is passed to storage directly, along with
;;; the map of options.
;;;
;;; Options currently supported by extraction:
;;; - `:user 6` giving the primary key for a user whose personal collections should be extracted.
;;;
;;; Storage:
;;; The storage system might transform that stream in some arbitrary way. Storage is a dead end - it should perform side
;;; effects like writing to the disk or network, and return nothing.

  Returns a reducible stream of maps with `:serdes/meta` keys on them. It should *not* be a stream of Toucan entities,
  but vanilla Clojure maps.

  In fact, Toucan's high-level niceties (eg. expanding JSON-encoded fields to Clojure data, decrypting, type
  conversions, or hydrating some relationship by default) are counterproductive when our goal is a database-level
  export. As a specific example, [[db/simple-select]] expands JSON but [[db/simple-insert!]] doesn't put it back.
  There's also no `simple-update!`, making a fresh insert diverge from an update.

  Defaults to using the helper `(raw-reducible-query model)` for the entire table, which is equivalent to
  `(db/simple-select-reducible model)` but without running post-select handlers. This returns vanilla maps, not

  They should follow the pattern of:
  - Convert to a vanilla Clojure map, not a [[models/IModel]] instance.

;;; +----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
;;; Deserialization is split into two stages, mirroring serialization. They are called ingestion and loading.
;;; Ingestion turns whatever serialized form (eg. a tree of YAML files) was produced by storage into Clojure maps with
;;; `:serdes/meta` maps. Loading imports those entities into the appdb, updating and inserting rows as needed.
;;;
;;; Ingestion:
;;; Ingestion is intended to be a black box, like storage above. [[Ingestable]] is a protocol to allow easy [[reify]]
;;; usage for testing in-memory deserialization.
;;;
;;; Factory functions consume some details (like a file path) and return an [[Ingestable]], with its two methods:
;;; - `(ingest-list ingestable)` returns a reducible stream of `:serdes/meta` paths in any order.
;;; - `(ingest-one ingestable meta-path)` ingests a single entity into memory, returning it as a map.
;;;
;;; This two-stage design avoids needing all the data in memory at once, where that's practical with the underlying
;;; storage media (eg. files).
;;;
;;; Loading:
;;; Loading tries to find corresponding entities in the destination appdb by entity ID or identity hash, and update
;;; those rows rather than duplicating.
;;; The entry point is [[metabase-enterprise.serialization.v2.load/load-metabase]]. The top-level process works like
;;; this:
;;; - `(ingest-list ingestable)` gets the `:serdes/meta` "path" for every exported entity in arbitrary order.
;;;     - `(ingest-one meta-map opts)` is called on each first to ingest the value into memory, then
;;;     - `(serdes-dependencies ingested)` to get a list of other paths that need to be loaded first.
;;;         - The default is an empty list.
;;;     - The idea of dependencies is eg. a database must be loaded before its tables, a table before its fields, a
;;;       collection's ancestors before the collection itself.
;;;     - Dependencies are loaded recursively in postorder; circular dependencies cause the process to throw.
;;; - Having found an entity it can really load, check for any existing one:
;;;     - `(load-find-local path)` returns the corresponding primary key, or nil.
;;; - Then it calls `(load-one! ingested maybe-local-entity)`, passing the `ingested` value and either `nil` or the
;;;       Toucan entity corresponding to the incoming map.
;;;     - `load-one!` is a side-effecting black box to the rest of the deserialization process.
;;;       It returns the primary key of the new or existing entity, which is necessary to resolve foreign keys between
;;;       imported entities.
;;;     - The table of "local" entities found by the prescan is updated to include newly loaded ones.
;;;
;;;
;;; `load-one!` has a default implementation that works for most models:
;;; - Call `(load-xform ingested)` to massage the map as needed.
;;;     - This is the spot to override, for example to convert a foreign key from portable entity ID into a database ID.
;;; - Then, call either:
;;;     - `(load-update! ingested local-entity)` if the local entity exists, or
;;;     - `(load-insert! ingested)` if the entity is new.
;;;   Both of these have the obvious defaults of [[jdbc/update!]] or [[jdbc/insert!]].
