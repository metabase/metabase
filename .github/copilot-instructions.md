# Metabase Developer Assistant Instructions

For detailed coding standards and conventions, see `CLAUDE.md` and the skills in `.claude/skills/`.

## Code Review Standards

When performing a code review:

- Only flag actual issues worth mentioning
- Do not post comments congratulating someone for following conventions
- Do not post "looks good" comments on correct code
- Be specific and actionable in feedback
- Explain the "why" behind recommendations

Language-specific rules are in `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md`.
