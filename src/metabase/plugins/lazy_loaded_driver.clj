(ns metabase.plugins.lazy-loaded-driver
  "Implementation for a delayed-load driver that implements a few basic driver methods (`available?`, `display-name`,
  and `connection-properties`) needed for things like setup using the information provided in the plugin manifest.
  Other methods resolve drivers using `driver/the-initialized-driver`, which calls `initialize!`; we'll wait until
  that call to do more memory-intensive things like registering a JDBC driver or loading the actual driver namespace.

  See https://github.com/metabase/metabase/wiki/Metabase-Plugin-Manifest-Reference for all the options allowed for a
  plugin manifest."
