  "Our wrapper for grouper -- the batch processing utility.

  Note:
  - These utilities should only be used for scenarios where data consistency is not a requirement,
    Execution is best effort and may not occur as the batched items are not persisted.
  - Suitable for use cases that can tolerate lag time in processing. For example, updating
    last_used_at of cards after a query execution. Things like recording view_log should not use
    grouper since it's important to have the data immediately available.


  Batch processing can be disabled by setting the environment variable `MB_DISABLE_GROUPER_BATCH_PROCESSING=true`."
