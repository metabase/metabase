;; Fields should be returned in the following order:

;;
;; 2.  Aggregation Fields (e.g. sum, count)
;;
;; 3.  Fields clause Fields, if they were added explicitly
;;
;; 4.  All other Fields, sorted by:
;;     A.  :position (ascending)
;;         Users can manually specify default Field ordering for a Table in the Metadata admin. In that case, return Fields in the specified
;;         order; most of the time they'll have the default value of 0, in which case we'll compare...
;;
;;     B.  :special_type "group" -- :id Fields, then :name Fields, then everyting else
;;         Attempt to put the most relevant Fields first. Order the Fields as follows:
;;         1.  :id Fields
;;         2.  :name Fields
;;         3.  all other Fields
;;
;;     C.  Field Name
;;         When two Fields have the same :position and :special_type "group", fall back to sorting Fields alphabetically by name.
;;         This is arbitrary, but it makes the QP deterministic by keeping the results in a consistent order, which makes it testable.
