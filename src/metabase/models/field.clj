;;; Field permissions
;; There are several API endpoints where large instances can return many thousands of Fields. Normally Fields require
;; a DB call to fetch information about their Table, because a Field's permissions set is the same as its parent
;; Table's. To make API endpoints perform well, we have use two strategies:
;; 1)  If a Field's Table is already hydrated, there is no need to manually fetch the information a second time
;; 2)  Failing that, we cache the corresponding permissions sets for each *Table ID* for a few seconds to minimize the
;;     number of DB calls that are made. See discussion below for more details.

(def ^:private ^{:arglists '([table-id])} perms-objects-set*
  "Cached lookup for the permissions set for a table with `table-id`. This is done so a single API call or other unit of
  computation doesn't accidentally end up in a situation where thousands of DB calls end up being made to calculate
  permissions for a large number of Fields. Thus, the cache only persists for 5 seconds.

  Of course, no DB lookups are needed at all if the Field already has a hydrated Table. However, mistakes are
  possible, and I did not extensively audit every single code pathway that uses sequences of Fields and permissions,
  so this caching is added as a failsafe in case Table hydration wasn't done.

  Please note this only caches one entry PER TABLE ID. Thus, even a million Tables (which is more than I hope we ever
  see), would require only a few megs of RAM, and again only if every single Table was looked up in a span of 5
  seconds."
