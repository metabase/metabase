# UserHasSeen

This is a convience API around tracking whether users have seen / acknowledged something in the app, and is built on top of the User-Key-Value api on the backend.
This was originally added as a way to surrport product callouts in the app, but could be used anytime we need to track a flag on a per-user basis

# Docs

This component accepts the following props:

- id: `string` The id of the thing we want the user to acknowledge. This should be unique across the application
- withContext: `boolean` Flag that determines if this component should attempt to work with the `UserHasSeenAll` component if it is present. Defaults to `true`
- children: `({hasSeen: boolean, ack: () => void})` Function to render children that is passed the hasSeen flag, as well as an acknowledgement function that can be used to set `hasSeen` to true
