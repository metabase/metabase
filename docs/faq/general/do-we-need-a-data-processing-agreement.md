# Do we need a Data Processing Agreement with Metabase to comply with GDPR?

Metabase is a self-hosted application, and as such we have no access to any data on your instance. We only collect [anonymized usage stats](../../information-collection.md) if you opted-in during installation, but even in that case, we see no personally identifiable data. As such, we are not a data processor for the purposes of GDPR.
