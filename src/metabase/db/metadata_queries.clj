  "The absolute maximum number of results to return for a `field-distinct-values` query. Normally Fields with 100 or
  less values (at the time of this writing) get marked as `auto-list` Fields, meaning we save all their distinct
  values in a FieldValues object, which powers a list widget in the FE when using the Field for filtering in the QB.
  Admins can however manually mark any Field as `list`, which is effectively ordering Metabase to keep FieldValues for
  the Field regardless of its cardinality.

  Of course, if a User does something crazy, like mark a million-arity Field as List, we don't want Metabase to
  explode trying to make their dreams a reality; we need some sort of hard limit to prevent catastrophes. So this
  limit is effectively a safety to prevent Users from nuking their own instance for Fields that really shouldn't be
  List Fields at all. For these very-high-cardinality Fields, we're effectively capping the number of
  FieldValues that get could saved.

  This number should be a balance of:

  * Not being too low, which would definitely result in GitHub issues along the lines of 'My 500-distinct-value Field
    that I marked as List is not showing all values in the List Widget'
  * Not being too high, which would result in Metabase running out of memory dealing with too many values"
