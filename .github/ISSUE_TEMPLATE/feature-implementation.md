labels: ".Feature"
assignees: ''

This demonstrates a workflow and implementation plan around feature X that we can use in features that go out in a release. There should be a paragraph description of the problem we're trying to solve and a high level what the solution will be.

**Links**
- product doc: _link to product doc_
- eng doc: _link to technical design doc_
- feature branch: `branch-name` _this should be the feature branch where this work will be done in. PRs will be delivered against this branch_
- Issue links: _list of issues this should close when this is delivered_

**Implementation Plan**

**ETA**: MM/DD/YYYY (ETA of merged feature when we start work)

_(each individual item in list should correspond to a PR and be less than one week of work maximum!)_

- [x] step 1: #somePRnumber
- [ ] step 2
- [ ] step 3

**Needs to happen before merge**

_(we can put stuff like translations, docs, testing, etc)_

- [ ] Design polish
- [ ] String translations
- [ ] Test on case X, Y, Z
- [ ] Write rough pass documents for handoff to customer success
