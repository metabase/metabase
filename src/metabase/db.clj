  "API namespace for the application database (app-db).

  It has a few different functions you might need:
  - A connectible for the app-db [[app-db]] and [[data-source]]
  - Information about the app-db: [[db-is-set-up?]], [[db-type]], [[quoting-style]]
  - a few other random functions that have built up for different purposes.

  Namespaces outside of src/metabase/db/ should not use any metabase.db.* namespace but use this api namespace."
