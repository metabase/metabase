# Ingestion Steps

## Clone Flexanalytics Repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/flexanalytics/dbt-business-intelligence
```

## Create dbt config (so it uses the correct SQL dialect plugin for macros):

Save this in `~/.dbt/profiles.yml`:

```yaml
dbt_business_intelligence:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: postgres
      host: localhost
      port: 5432
      user: nobody
      password: nothing
      dbname: dbt_bi
      schema: public
```

Note that it doesn't actually connect to Postgres so the `user`, `password`, etc. can be nonsense.

## Generate `target/manifest.json`:

If you have `uv` installed:

```sh
uvx --from dbt-core --with dbt-postgres dbt deps
uvx --from dbt-core --with dbt-postgres dbt parse
```

If you don't have `uv` installed but have `dbt` itself installed you should instead be able to do:

```sh
dbt deps
dbt parse
```

I haven't tested this.

`target/manifest.json` should now exist.

## Convert the manifest to Metabase metrics

From a dev REPL (needs the `:ee` alias on the classpath for the serdes YAML writer):

```clojure
(require '[dev.dbt-import.core :as dbt-import])

(dbt-import/convert! {:manifest "/path/to/dbt-business-intelligence/target/manifest.json"
                      :out-dir  "/path/to/serdes-out"
                      :config   {:databases     {"dbt_bi" "Sales DB"}   ; warehouse db name -> Metabase Database name
                                 :driver        :postgres               ; the Metabase driver for those databases
                                 :creator-email "admin@example.com"}})  ; the user the cards are created as
```

The config's `:databases` is the only mapping the manifest cannot supply: the key is the warehouse database as dbt
knows it (`node_relation.database` in the manifest), the value is the name of the Metabase Database it is connected
as. `:driver` picks whose `database-type->base-type` turns the project's declared column types into Metabase base
types. `:base-types` overrides that for types the driver does not know and `:collection-name` renames the target
collection; both are optional. A column the project does not document, or documents without a `data_type`, is emitted
without a base type: the instance supplies it when the import binds the field, and a column that does not exist in the
warehouse fails there.

`convert!` returns a report: `:converted` lists each metric with its `entity_id` and file, and `:unsupported` lists
every metric that could not be converted with the reason. Nothing is silently dropped. Entity IDs are derived from
the dbt metric's unique ID, so re-running and re-importing updates the existing cards instead of duplicating them.

The output is a serdes tree, `collections/main/<collection>.yaml` plus one card per metric under
`collections/main/<collection>/`, in the same format `export` produces. Import it into the instance from QRES-2:

```sh
MB_DB_CONNECTION_URI=... clojure -M:run:ee import /path/to/serdes-out -e
```

Then open each metric in the UI, run it, and compare the number against a hand-written SQL query.

Pipeline: `parse` (manifest -> IR) -> `resolve` (IR + config -> portable refs, base types, entity ids) -> `emit`
(MBQL 5 + serdes YAML). Each stage only knows the previous stage's schema, see `dev.dbt-import.schemas.*`.
