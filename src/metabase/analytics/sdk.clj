  "Middleware, vars, and a reporting helper for tracking analytics information about the Metabase embedding client.

  Here is how we collect analytics information about the embedding client:
  The X-Metabase-Client and X-Metabase-Client-Version headers are sent, and if present bound to *metabase-client* and *metabase-client-version* respectively.

  When we execute a query, or record a view log, we include the *client* and *version* as embedding_client and embedding_version in the view_log or query_execution record.

  then we can use the information on the tables to track information about the embedding client,
  and TODO: send it out in `summarize-execution`."
