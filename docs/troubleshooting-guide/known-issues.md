## How to find a known bug

You may be encountering a bug if your work in Metabase is crashing, missing, or not being saved.

If you think something is missing or behaving oddly, but you've never been able to do it before, try [searching for a product limitation](#how-to-find-a-known-product-limitation) instead.

1. Go to [Metabase Github issues page](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/issues).

2. Click on the **Label** dropdown and select `Type: Bug`.

> If you're encountering problems after your Metabase version was recently upgraded, you can add the label `.Regression`.

3. Choose least one value in the **Label** dropdown that matches the feature you're having trouble with.

> Add additional keywords to the search bar above the list of results. Hit Enter/Return to run the search.

> Click **Sort** and select the thumbs up emoji (👍) to view the most commonly encountered bugs.

5. If you find an existing bug that matches your problem, leave a thumbs up or comment to help the team prioritize it.

6. If you can't find your problem, and you're sure that it's not a [product limitation](#how-to-find-a-known-product-limitation), you can [create a new bug report](./bugs.html).
