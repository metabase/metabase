# Data reference

![Data reference field](./images/data-reference-fields.png)

Metabase's data reference section is a way to browse your metadata.

The data reference includes:

- [Databases](#databases)
- [Glossary](#glossary)
- [Segments](#segments)

You can open the data reference from:

- The left sidebar > **Data** > **Databases** > **Learn about our data** (in the upper right).
- Hovering over a table in the data browser and clicking on the book icon.
- The native/SQL editor > **Book** icon.

You can also visit `https://[your metabase here]/reference`.

## Databases

The data reference is a collection of pages organized by database, then schemas in that database (if you have several schemas), and finally tables in that database - the same structure you use to [pick data](../questions/query-builder/editor.md#picking-data). The data reference section is a great place to find information about the [data types](https://www.metabase.com/learn/grow-your-data-skills/data-fundamentals/data-types-overview) of columns in your data.

### Database details

When you click into a database, you'll see:

- **Details tab**: Contains metadata about the database, including general description, why this database is interesting, and things to be aware of.
- **Tables tab**: Displays table names and descriptions. Click on a table to view its details and fields.

For each table, you can view:

- Table description and metadata
- Fields in the table with their types and descriptions
- Sample values for columns (when available)
- Questions about this table (if you have permission to view them)
- Option to create an X-ray of the table

Admins can edit the metadata in this reference by clicking the **Edit** button in the upper right. Admins can also edit metabadata in the [admin settings](../data-modeling/metadata-editing.md).

## Glossary

The glossary is a place where anyone can define terms relevant to your data. Currently, the glossary is a simple key-value store of terms and their definitions.

To add a new term, click **+ New term**. Add the term name and its definitions, then click the checkmark to save the term to the glossary.

## Segments

![Segments browser](./images/segments-browser.png)

If your admins have created any [segments](../data-modeling/segments.md), you can browse them in this section.

## Data reference in the native editor

Sometimes when you're writing a query, you might forget the exact names of different tables or columns, or which table contains what. That’s where the **Data reference** comes in handy.

To bring up the data reference panel in the native/SQL editor, click on the open book icon.

This panel lists all the databases you have access to, and the [models](../data-modeling/models.md) and tables, and the fields inside of them.

![Data reference sidebar](./images/DataReference.png)

Click the model or table to see a description of it and a list of all the columns it has. Each table or column will only contain a description if your admin wrote something in the table metadata section of the admin panel.

If you click on a column you’re interested in, you’ll see a description of its contents, as well as a list of sample values for columns that don't have a huge number of distinct values.

### Connections

In the data reference sidebar in the native editor, under **Connections**, you can find a list of table relationships (defined by [foreign keys](https://www.metabase.com/glossary/foreign-key)).

If a foreign key relationship exists in your database, but doesn't show up in your Metabase, your admin will need to update your [Metabase table metadata](../data-modeling/metadata-editing.md).
