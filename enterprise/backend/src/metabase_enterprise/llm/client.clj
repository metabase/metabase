(ns metabase-enterprise.llm.client
  "A wrapper around the OpenAI client API.

  The `create-chat-completion` function combines several useful middlewares to create a client that can be used for AI
  completions. Note that this is a function that returns a function. Example usage is as follows:

  ```clojure
   ((create-chat-completion)
   {:messages [{:role \"system\" :content \"You are a helpful assistant.\"}
               {:role \"user\" :content \"Who won the world series in 2020?\"}
               {:role \"assistant\" :content \"The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020.\"}
               {:role \"user\" :content \"Where was it played?\"}]})
  ```

  The user need only provide a map of messages following the standard
  [OpenAI chat completions API format](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-generation/chat-completions-api).

  Note that while this is not a _de jure_ standard, it is evolving as a _de facto_ standard as can be seen by use of the
  [OpenAI Client](https://platform.openai.com/docs/libraries) with [Llama API](https://docs.llama-api.com/essentials/chat).
