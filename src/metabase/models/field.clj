  Of course, no DB lookups are needed at all if the Field already has a hydrated Table. However, mistakes are
  possible, and I did not extensively audit every single code pathway that uses sequences of Fields and permissions,
  so this caching is added as a failsafe in case Table hydration wasn't done.
