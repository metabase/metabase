## Downloading Jars

`mb-download` will let you download a jar to a given path or straight into `$JARS`.

``` bash
$ ./mb-download -h
Usage: mb-download 0.42.2
Usage: mb-download 1.45.2
Usage: mb-download 1.45.2 ~/path/to/my/jars

protip: this script will read from $JARS, and use that as your jar directory.
```
