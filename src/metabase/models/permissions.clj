  "Low-level Metabase permissions system definition and utility functions.

  The Metabase permissions system is based around permissions *paths* that are granted to individual
  [[metabase.models.permissions-group]]s.

  ### Core concepts

  Permissions are granted to individual [[metabase.models.permissions-group]]s, and Users are members of one or more
  Permissions Groups. Permissions Groups are like 'roles' in other permissions systems. There are a few 'magic'
  Permissions Groups: the [[metabase.models.permissions-group/all-users]] Group, of which every User is a member and
  cannot be removed; and the [[metabase.models.permissions-group/admin]] Group, of which every superuser (i.e., every
  User with `is_superuser`) is a member.

  The permissions needed to perform an action are represented as slash-delimited path strings, for example
  `/db/1/schema/PUBLIC/`. Each slash represents a different part of the permissions path, and each permissions path
  must start and end with a slash. Permissions use the same path representation for both the permissions required to
  perform an action and the permissions granted to individual Groups.

  Permissions paths use a prefix system where a User is normally allowed to perform any action if one of their Groups
  has *any* permissions entry that is a prefix for the permission required to perform that action. For example, if
  reading Database 1 requires the permission `/db/1/read/`, then the current User may perform that action if they have
  `/db/1/read/` permissions, or if they have `/db/1/`, or even full `/` superuser permissions.

  This prefix system allows us to easily and efficiently query the application database to find relevant matching
  permissions matching an path or path using `LIKE`; see [[metabase.models.database/pre-delete]] for
  an example of the sort of efficient queries the prefix system facilitates.

  The union of all permissions the current User's gets from all groups of which they are a member are automatically
  bound to [[metabase.api.common/*current-user-permissions-set*]] by
  [[metabase.server.middleware.session/bind-current-user]] for every REST API request, and in other places when
  queries are ran in a non-API thread (e.g. for scheduled Dashboard Subscriptions).

  ### Different types of permissions

  There are two main types of permissions:

  * _data permissions_ -- permissions to view, update, or run ad-hoc or SQL queries against a Database or Table.

  * _Collection permissions_ -- permissions to view/curate/etc. an individual [[metabase.models.collection]] and the
    items inside it. Collection permissions apply to individual Collections and to any non-Collection items inside that
    Collection. Child Collections get their own permissions. Many objects such as Cards (a.k.a. *Saved Questions*) and
    Dashboards get their permissions from the Collection in which they live.

  ### Enterprise-only permissions and \"anti-permissions\"

  In addition to data permissions and Collection permissions, a User can also be granted four additional types of
  permissions.

  * _root permissions_ -- permissions for `/`, i.e. full access for everything. Automatically granted to
    the [[metabase.models.permissions-group/admin]] group that gets created on first launch. Because `/` is a prefix
    for every permissions path, admins have permissions to do everything.

  * _segmented permissions_ -- a special grant for a Table that applies sandboxing, a.k.a. row-level permissions,
    a.k.a. segmented permissions, to any queries ran by the User when that User does not have full data permissions.
    Segmented permissions allow a User to run ad-hoc MBQL queries against the Table in question; regardless of whether
    they have relevant Collection permissions, queries against the sandboxed Table are rewritten to replace the Table
    itself with a special type of nested query called a
    [[metabase-enterprise.sandbox.models.group-table-access-policy]], or _GTAP_. Note that segmented permissions are
    both additive and subtractive -- they are additive because they grant (sandboxed) ad-hoc query access for a Table,
    but subtractive in that any access thru a Saved Question will now be sandboxed as well.

    Additional things to know:

    * Sandboxed permissions are only available in Metabase® Enterprise Edition™.

    * Only one GTAP may defined per-Group per-Table (this is an application-DB-level constraint). A User may have
      multiple applicable GTAPs if they are members of multiple groups that have sandboxed anti-perms for that Table; in
      that case, the QP signals an error if multiple GTAPs apply to a given Table for the current User (see
      [[metabase-enterprise.sandbox.query-processor.middleware.row-level-restrictions/assert-one-gtap-per-table]]).

    * Segmented (sandboxing) permissions and GTAPs are tied together, and a Group should be given both (or both
      should be deleted) at the same time. This is *not* currently enforced as a hard application DB constraint, but is
      done in the respective Toucan pre-delete actions. The QP will signal an error if the current user has segmented
      permissions but no matching GTAP exists.

    * Segmented permissions can also be used to enforce column-level permissions -- any column not returned by the
      underlying GTAP query is not allowed to be referenced by the parent query thru other means such as filter clauses.
      See [[metabase-enterprise.sandbox.query-processor.middleware.column-level-perms-check]].

    * GTAPs are not allowed to add columns not present in the original Table, or change their effective type to
      something incompatible (this constraint is in place so we other things continue to work transparently regardless
      of whether the Table is swapped out.) See
      [[metabase-enterprise.sandbox.models.group-table-access-policy/check-columns-match-table]]

  * *block \"anti-permissions\"* are per-Group, per-Table grants that tell Metabase to disallow running Saved
    Questions unless the User has data permissions (in other words, disregard Collection permissions). These are
    referred to as \"anti-permissions\" because they are subtractive grants that take away permissions from what the
    User would otherwise have. See the `Determining query permissions` section below for more details. As with
    segmented permissions, block anti-permissions are only available in Metabase® Enterprise Edition™.

  * _Application permisisons_ -- are per-Group permissions that give non-admin users access to features like:
    change instance's Settings; access Audit, Tools, Troubleshooting ...

  ### Determining CRUD permissions in the REST API

  REST API permissions checks are generally done in various `metabase.api.*` namespaces. Whether the current User can
  perform various CRUD actions are defined by [[metabase.models.interface/can-read?]] (in the API sense, not in the
  run-query sense) and [[metabase.models.interface/can-write?]] as well as the
  newer [[metabase.models.interface/can-create?]] and [[metabase.models.interface/can-update?]] methods.
  Implementations for these methods live in `metabase.models.*` namespaces.

  The implementation of these methods is up to individual models. The majority of implementations check whether
  [[metabase.api.common/*current-user-permissions-set*]] includes permissions for a given path (action)
  using [[set-has-full-permissions?]], or for a set of paths using [[set-has-full-permissions-for-set?]].

  Other implementations check whether a user has _partial permissions_ for a path or set
  using [[set-has-partial-permissions?]] or [[set-has-partial-permissions-for-set?]]. Partial permissions means that
  the User has permissions for some subpath of the path in question, e.g. `/db/1/read/` is considered to be partial
  permissions for `/db/1/`. For example the [[metabase.models.interface/can-read?]] implementation for Database checks
  whether the current User has *any* permissions for that Database; a User can fetch Database 1 from API
  endpoints (\"read\" it) if they have any permissions starting with `/db/1/`, for example `/db/1/` itself (full
  permissions) `/db/1/native/` (ad-hoc SQL query permissions) or permissions, or
  `/db/1/schema/PUBLIC/table/2/query/` (run ad-hoc queries against Table 2 permissions).

  ### Determining query permissions

  Normally, a User is allowed to view (i.e., run the query for) a Saved Question if they have read permissions for the
  Collection in which Saved Question lives, **or** if they have data permissions for the Database and Table(s) the
  Question accesses. The main idea here is that some Users with more permissions can go create a curated set of Saved
  Questions they deem appropriate for less-privileged Users to see, and put them in a Collection they can see. These
  Users would still be prevented from poking around things on their own, however.

  The Query Processor middleware in [[metabase.query-processor.middleware.permissions]],
  [[metabase-enterprise.sandbox.query-processor.middleware.row-level-restrictions]], and
  [[metabase-enterprise.advanced-permissions.models.permissions.block-permissions]] determines whether the current
  User has permissions to run the current query. Permissions are as follows:

  | Data perms? | Coll perms? | Block? | Segmented? | Can run? |
  | ----------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- | -------- |
  |          no |          no |     no |         no |       ⛔ |
  |          no |          no |     no |        yes |       ⚠️ |
  |          no |          no |    yes |         no |       ⛔ |
  |          no |          no |    yes |        yes |       ⚠️ |
  |          no |         yes |     no |         no |       ✅ |
  |          no |         yes |     no |        yes |       ⚠️ |
  |          no |         yes |    yes |         no |       ⛔ |
