  "Provides a very simple Emacs Lisp hook-style events system using Methodical. See
  https://github.com/metabase/metabase/issues/19812 for more information.

  Publish an event, which consists of a [[Topic]] keyword and an event map using [[publish-event!]], 'subscribe' to
  events by writing method implementations of [[publish-event!]].

  On launch, all namespaces starting with `metabase.events.*` will get loaded automatically

  'Subscribe' to an event by add a Methodical method implementation. Since this uses
  the [[methodical/do-method-combination]], all multiple method implementations can be called for a single invocation.
  The order is indeterminate, but return value is ignored.

  Don't write method implementations for the event names themselves, e.g. `:event/database-create`, because these will
  stomp on other methods with the same key:

    ;; bad! If someone else writes a method for `:event/database-create`, it will stomp on this
    (methodical/defmethod events/publish-event! :event/database-create
