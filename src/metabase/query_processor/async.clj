(ns metabase.query-processor.async
  "Async versions of the usual public query processor functions. Instead of blocking while the query is ran, these
  functions all return a `core.async` channel that can be used to fetch the results when they become available.

  Each connected database is limited to a maximum of 15 simultaneous queries (configurable) using these methods; any
  additional queries will park the thread. Super-useful for writing high-performance API endpoints. Prefer these
  methods to the old-school synchronous versions.

  How is this achieved? For each Database, we'll maintain a channel that acts as a counting semaphore; the channel
  will initially contain 15 permits. Each incoming request will asynchronously read from the channel until it acquires
  a permit, then put it back when it finishes."
