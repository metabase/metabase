# How do I reset my password?

If you're having trouble logging in due to a forgotten password, click the `I seem to have forgotten my password` button in the lower right of the log-in screen. If your Metabase administrator has already [configured your email settings](02-setting-up-email.md), you will be able to generate a Reset Password email. If email has not been configured, you will need to contact them to perform a password reset.
