/**
 * Per-spec helpers for tests/sandboxing-misconfiguration.spec.ts — port of
 * e2e/test/scenarios/permissions/sandboxing/sandboxing-misconfiguration.cy.spec.ts
 * and the parts of helpers/e2e-sandboxing-helpers.ts that spec uses.
 *
 * Read-only reuse (porting rule 9 — no shared support module is edited):
 *  - support/sandboxing-via-ui.ts  → signInAs, assertRunningAs,
 *    assignAttributeToUser, configureSandboxPolicy, createUserFromRawData,
 *    assertUserGroupIds, getCardResponses, rowsShouldContainOnlyOneCategory,
 *    gizmoViewer and the USER_GROUPS ids. Those are exact ports of the same
 *    upstream helper file, so duplicating them here would be strictly worse.
 *  - support/schema-viewer.ts      → WRITABLE_DB_ID, queryWritableDB,
 *    getTableId, resyncDatabase.
 *  - support/table-collection-permissions.ts → blockUserGroupPermissions.
 *  - support/factories.ts          → createQuestion.
 *
 * ── What this file adds on top of sandboxing-via-ui ────────────────────────
 *
 * 1. `assertResponseFailsClosed` — the whole point of the spec, and the one
 *    helper sandboxing-via-ui does not port (it isn't used there).
 * 2. `setUpProductsTable` — this spec does NOT use the sample database. It
 *    builds a two-row `products` table in the writable QA postgres.
 * 3. `waitForSyncedField` — see its docstring; upstream's
 *    `resyncDatabase({ tableName })` is satisfied by a STALE table row.
 *
 * ── Auth, restated because it is the whole ballgame ────────────────────────
 *
 * Upstream's `signInAs` is `cy.request("POST", "/api/session")`, which in
 * Cypress makes every subsequent `cy.request` run as that user. Here the
 * imported `signInAs` routes the session POST through a THROWAWAY request
 * context, so `mb.api` stays admin and the returned client is the new user.
 * `assertRunningAs` pins that down at both ends — measured on this slot, not
 * inherited from the neighbouring spec's comment.

/**
 * Port of `configureSandboxPolicy` (e2e-sandboxing-helpers.ts:337-418),

 * two-branch port lives in support/sandboxing-via-ui.ts.
 *
 * 🔴 Why this is not just `configureSandboxPolicy` from sandboxing-via-ui:
 * that helper goes straight from `/admin/permissions/data/database/<id>` to
 * `menuitem[name=<tableName>]`, which is correct for a database with ONE
 * schema. Upstream only ever points it at the sample database (one schema) or
 * at a freshly-reset `writable_db` (also one schema, `public`).
 *
 * On this harness `writable_db` is SHARED between slots and is never reset
 * (`resetWritableDb` is unported), so it accumulates debris schemas from
 * other specs. Measured on slot 2: `/admin/permissions/data/database/2`
 * listed 29 schema menuitems (`Domestic`, `public`, `Schema A`…`Schema Z`,
 * `Wild`) and NO table menuitems, so the table click timed out. Descending
 * into the schema first yields `Products` (verified: the same sidebar then
 * lists `Products`, `IP Addresses`, `Many Data Types`, … — themselves debris
 * from neighbouring ports).
 *
 * The schema click is CONDITIONAL, so this is not a behavioural fork: in a
 * clean single-schema environment there is no schema menuitem and the flow is
 * byte-for-byte upstream's.

  // Wait for the branch to be DECIDABLE, not merely for the sidebar to have
  // painted something.
  //
  // The old anchor here was `getByRole("menuitem").first()`, which is
  // satisfied by whatever the sidebar renders first. `count()` is a SINGLE,
  // non-retrying sample, so it could be taken before the table list arrived,
  // read 0, and send the flow down the schema branch — where it then waited
  // the full 30s for a `public` menuitem, which is the CI failure
  // (`locator.click: Timeout 30000ms exceeded | waiting for
  // getByRole('menuitem', {name:'public', exact:true})`).
  //
  // And on this harness that branch is now unreachable by design: since
  // 651bc2d5d25 each worker gets its OWN, freshly created writable database
  // (support/writable-db.ts), so `public` is its only schema and the
  // permissions sidebar goes straight to TABLES. `public` therefore never
  // appears at all — which is why taking that branch cannot recover, and why
  // an early `count()` is the only way to reach it. (The schema branch is
  // kept, not deleted: it is still correct for a multi-schema database, e.g.
  // the shared `writable_db` this helper was originally measured against.)
  //
  // Racing the two locators makes the sample happen only once the sidebar has
  // committed to one shape or the other. It changes no assertion.
  //
  // ── WHY THAT RACE WAS NOT ENOUGH ──────────────────────────────────────────
  // CI run 29825096184 (shard 38) failed with the SAME 30s
  // `menuitem name='public'` click timeout WITH the race already in the tree
  // (verified by `git show f39d02a13d4 -- <this file>`). So the race fixed
  // *when* the sample is taken but not the thing that turns a bad sample into
  // a 30s hard failure: the decision is one-shot and IRREVERSIBLE. Once the
  // `count() === 0` branch is entered, the flow is committed to clicking a
  // locator that — on a single-schema database, which is every per-worker
  // writable database (651bc2d5d25) — will never exist, and the only exit is
  // the full click timeout.
  //
  // Measured on this harness while investigating, so the next reader does not
  // re-derive it:
  //   - The `postgres-writable` snapshot's 8 stale tables are ALL in `public`,
  //     so `database.schemasCount() > 1` (data-sidebar.ts `shouldIncludeSchemas`)
  //     is false both before and after a sync. `public` is therefore not merely
  //     unlikely here, it is unreachable.
  //   - The sidebar does NOT re-render when db 2's metadata changes behind it
  //     (the RTK `getDatabaseMetadata` query does not poll): dropping the
  //     warehouse table and forcing `POST /sync_schema` left the sidebar
  //     showing `Products` for 12s. So a mid-test wipe cannot un-paint an
  //     already-painted sidebar either.
  // Neither of those explains a 0 sample in a HEALTHY page, and the failure
  // did not reproduce locally. What is left is a sample taken across a
  // document boundary: the pre-wait passes against the painted sidebar, the
  // page remounts/reloads, and `count()` — which returns 0 rather than
  // throwing on a swapped-out document — reads 0. The CI timing supports it:
  // the failing attempt spent ~7.5s before the click (37550ms total, 30000ms
  // of it the timeout) where the passing retry finished the WHOLE test in
  // 9983ms, i.e. it was the slow, contended load. That mechanism is not proven
  // — it is the residual after the two measurements above — so the change
  // below is written to survive it AND to name the real state next time.
  //
  // Retrying the decide-and-click is safe in both directions: with tables
  // shown, `tableItem.click()` succeeds on the first pass; with schemas shown,
  // the schema click descends and the retry then finds the table directly. No
  // assertion is relaxed — if neither ever resolves this still fails, just
  // with the sidebar's actual contents instead of an opaque timeout.
  //
  // The `.or(...).toBeVisible()` pre-wait is gone: `toPass` subsumes it (its
  // first iteration is the same sample) and keeping it would let a 10s opaque
  // "expected to be visible" shadow the diagnostic below on exactly the runs
  // where the diagnostic is the point.
