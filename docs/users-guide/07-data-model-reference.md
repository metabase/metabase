You can get to the data model reference at any time by clicking on the **Book** icon in the top righthand corner of the screen.

After clicking the icon, the **Data Reference** tab will open.  It lists all the databases you have access to and the tables inside them.

Click on the table you would like to explore further to see a description of it and a list of all the fields it contains.

If you click on a field of interest, you will see a description of the field's contents, as well as suggestions for queries based on that field.

In addition to looking at a table's fields, you can also look at its connections if your table includes any.  Click on **Connections** to view them (located next to **Field** button).
