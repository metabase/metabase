  "Logic for determining which datasets to test against.

  By default, we'll test against against only the :h2 (H2) dataset; otherwise, you can specify which datasets to test
  against by setting the env var `DRIVERS` to a comma-separated list of dataset names, e.g.

    # test against :h2 and :mongo
    DRIVERS=h2,mongo

    # just test against :h2 (default)
    DRIVERS=h2"

      DRIVERS=h2,mongo lein test

  *  temporarily from the REPL, by using the `with-test-drivers-macro`

      (with-test-drivers #{:postgres}

  *  for the duration of a REPL session, by calling `set-test-drivers!`

  Note that this is merely the set of drivers test *can* run against; tests actually run against the union of the
  'test drivers' set and the set of drivers listed in the test itself. e.g.

    (deftest my-test
      ;; this will run against H2 if `(test-drivers)` contains `:h2`, and Postgres if `(test-drivers)` contains
      ;; `:postgres`
      (datasets/test-drivers #{:h2 :postgres}
        ..))

  NOTE - For historic reasons `test-drivers` can be dereffed a if it were a delay, even tho it is not. Using it this
  way should be considered deprecated â€” please invoke it as a function call instead."
