# Autonomous Development Workflow

- Do not attempt to read or edit files outside the project folder
- Add failing tests first, then fix them
- Work autonomously in small, testable increments
- Run targeted tests, and lint continuously during development
- Prioritize understanding existing patterns before implementing
- Don't commit changes, leave it for the user to review and make commits
