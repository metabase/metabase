# ClickHouse Driver for Metabae

### Attribution

The ClickHouse driver for Metabase was originally developed and maintained by ClickHouse at https://github.com/ClickHouse/metabase-clickhouse-driver under the Apache License 2.0, as part of Metabase's [partner driver program](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/developers-guide/partner-and-community-drivers). It has since been added to Metabase as an officially supported driver.
