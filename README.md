## Installation

Metabase can be run just about anywhere so checkout our [Installation Guides](http://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/operations-guide/start.html#installing-and-running-metabase) for detailed instructions for various deployments.  Here's the TLDR:

### Docker

To run Metabase via Docker, just type

```sh
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 --name metabase metabase/metabase
```

### JVM Jar

To run the jar you will need to have a Java Runtime installed. As a quick check to see if you system already has one, try

```sh
java -version
```

If you see something like

```sh
java version "1.8.0_51"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_51-b16)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.51-b03, mixed mode)
```

you are good to go. Otherwise, download the Java Runtime Environment at http://java.com/

Go to the [Metabase Download Page](http://www.metabase.com/start/) and download the current build. Place the downloaded jar into a newly created directory (as it will create some files when it is run), and run it on the command line:

```sh
java -jar metabase.jar
```

Now, open a browser and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) , and you will be asked a set of questions that will set up a user account, and then you can add a database connection. For this to work you will need to get some information about which database you want to connect to, such as the Host Name and Port that it is running on, the Database Name and the User and Password that you will be using.

Once you have added this connection, you will be taken into the app and you'll be ready to ask your first question.

For a more detailed walkthrough, check out our [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) guide.
