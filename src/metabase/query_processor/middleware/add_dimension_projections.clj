(ns metabase.query-processor.middleware.add-dimension-projections
  "Middleware for adding remapping and other dimension related projections. This remaps Fields that have a corresponding
  Dimension object (which defines a remapping) in two different ways, depending on the `:type` attribute of the
  Dimension:

  `external` type Dimensions mean the Field's values will be replaced with corresponding values from a column on a
  different table, joined via a foreign key. A common use-case would be to replace FK IDs with the name of whatever it
  references, for example replacing a values of `venue.category_id` with values of `category.name`. Actual replacement
  of values happens on the frontend, so this middleware simply adds the column to be used for replacement (e.g.
  `category.name`) to the `:fields` clause in pre-processing, so the Field will be fetched. Recall that Fields
  referenced via with `:fk->` clauses imply that JOINs will take place, which are automatically handled later in the
  Query Processor pipeline. Additionally, this middleware will swap out and `:order-by` clauses referencing the
  original Field with ones referencing the remapped Field (for example, so we would sort by `category.name` instead of
  `category_id`).

  `internal` type Dimensions mean the Field's values are replaced by a user-defined map of values, stored in the
  `human_readable_values` column of a corresponding `FieldValues` object. A common use-case for this scenario would be
  to replace integer enum values with something more descriptive, for example replacing values of an enum `can_type`
  -- `0` becomes `Toucan`, `1` becomes `Pelican`, and so forth. This is handled exclusively in post-processing by
  adding extra columns and values to the results.

  In both cases, to accomplish values replacement on the frontend, the post-processing part of this middleware adds
  appropriate `:remapped_from` and `:remapped_to` attributes in the result `:cols` in post-processing.
  `:remapped_from` and `:remapped_to` are the names of the columns, e.g. `category_id` is `:remapped_to` `name`, and
  `name` is `:remapped_from` `:category_id`."
