  "Middleware that limits the number of concurrent queries for each database.

  Each connected database is limited to a maximum of 15 simultaneous queries (configurable) using these methods; any
  additional queries will park the thread. Super-useful for writing high-performance API endpoints. Prefer these
  methods to the old-school synchronous versions.

  How is this achieved? For each Database, we'll maintain a thread pool executor to limit the number of simultaneous
  queries."
