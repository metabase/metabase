       (unique-name :x \"A\")
       (unique-name :y \"A\")])
    ;; -> [\"A\" \"B\" \"A\" \"A_2\"]

  Finally, [[unique-name-generator]] accepts the following options to further customize behavior:

  ### `:name-key-fn`

  Generated aliases are unique by the value of `[id (name-key-fn original-name)]`; the default is `identity`, so by
  default aliases are unique by `[id name-key-fn]`. Specify something custom here if you want to make the unique
  aliases unique by some other value, for example to make them unique without regards to case:

    (let [f (unique-name-generator :name-key-fn str/lower-case)]
      [(f \"x\")
       (f \"X\")
       (f \"X\")])
    ;; -> [\"x\" \"X_2\" \"X_3\"]

  This is useful for databases that treat column aliases as case-insensitive (see #19618 for some examples of this).

  ### `:unique-alias-fn`

  The function used to generate a potentially-unique alias given an original alias and unique suffix with the signature

    (unique-alias-fn original suffix)

  By default, combines them like `original_suffix`, but you can supply a custom function if you need to change this
  behavior:

    (let [f (unique-name-generator :unique-alias-fn (fn [x y] (format \"%s~~%s\" y x)))]
      [(f \"x\")
       (f \"x\")])
  ;; -> [\"x\" \"2~~x\"]

  This is useful if you need to constrain the generated suffix in some way, for example by limiting its length or
  escaping characters disallowed in a column alias.

  Values generated by this function are recursively checked for uniqueness, and will keep trying values a unique value
  is generated; for this reason the function *must* return a unique value for every unique input. Use caution when
  limiting the length of the identifier generated (consider appending a hash in cases like these)."
