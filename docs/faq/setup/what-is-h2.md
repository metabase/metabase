# What's H2?

H2 is the underlying application database that’s packaged with Metabase. H2 is a lightweight, in-memory database: perfect for getting spun up quickly, not so perfect for long-term usage. We recommend that you [migrate away from H2](../../operations-guide/migrating-from-h2.md) for production instances of Metabase.
