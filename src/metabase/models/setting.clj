  "Settings are a fast and simple way to create a setting that can be set from the admin page. They are saved to the
  application Database, but intelligently cached internally for super-fast lookups.

  Define a new Setting with [[defsetting]] (optionally supplying things like default value, type, or custom getters &
  setters):

    (defsetting mandrill-api-key \"API key for Mandrill\")

  The newly-defined Setting will automatically be made available to the frontend client depending on its [[Visibility]].

  You can also set the value via the corresponding env var, which looks like `MB_MANDRILL_API_KEY`, where the name of
  the Setting is converted to uppercase and dashes to underscores.

  The var created with [[defsetting]] can be used as a getter/setter, or you can use [[get]] and [[set!]]:

    (require '[metabase.models.setting :as setting])

    (setting/get :mandrill-api-key) ; only returns values set explicitly from the Admin Panel
    (mandrill-api-key)              ; returns value set in the Admin Panel, OR value of corresponding env var,
                                    ; OR the default value, if any (in that order)

    (setting/set! :mandrill-api-key \"NEW_KEY\")
    (mandrill-api-key \"NEW_KEY\")

    (setting/set! :mandrill-api-key nil)
    (mandrill-api-key nil)

  You can define additional Settings types adding implementations of [[default-tag-for-type]], [[get-value-of-type]],
  and [[set-value-of-type!]].

  [[admin-writable-settings]] and [[user-readable-values-map]] can be used to fetch *all* Admin-writable and
  User-readable Settings, respectively. See their docstrings for more information.

  ### Database-Local Settings

  Starting in 0.42.0, some Settings are allowed to have Database-specific values that override the normal site-wide
  value. These are similar in concept to buffer-local variables in Emacs Lisp.

  When a Setting is allowed to be Database-local, any values in [[*database-local-values*]] for that Setting will be
  returned preferentially to site-wide values of that Setting. [[*database-local-values*]] comes from the
  `Database.settings` column in the application DB. `nil` values in [[*database-local-values*]] are ignored, i.e. you
  cannot 'unset' a site-wide value with a Database-local one.

  Whether or not a Setting can be Database-local is controlled by the `:database-local` option passed
  to [[defsetting]]. There are three valid values of this option:

  * `:only` means this Setting can *only* have a Database-local value and cannot have a 'normal' site-wide value. It
  cannot be set via env var. Default values are still allowed for Database-local-only Settings. Database-local-only
  Settings are never returned by [[admin-writable-settings]] or [[user-readable-values-map]] regardless of
  their [[Visibility]].

  * `:allowed` means this Setting can be Database-local and can also have a normal site-wide value; if both are
  specified, the Database-specific value will be returned preferentially when we are in the context of a specific
  Database (i.e., [[*database-local-values*]] is bound).

  * `:never` means Database-specific values cannot be set for this Setting. Values in [[*database-local-values*]]
  will be ignored.

  `:never` is the default value of `:database-local`; to allow Database-local values, the Setting definition must
  explicitly specify `:database-local` `:only` or `:allowed`.

  Setting setter functions do not affect Database-local values; they always set the site-wide value. (At the time of
  this writing, there is not yet a FE-client-friendly way to set Database-local values. Just set them manually in the
  application DB until we figure that out.)

  See #19399 for more information about and motivation behind Database-local Settings."

  A setting can be set from the Admin Panel or via the corresponding env var, eg. `MB_MANDRILL_API_KEY` for the
  example above.

  You may optionally pass any of the `options` below:

  ###### `:default`

  The default value of the setting. This must be of the same type as the Setting type, e.g. the default for an
  `:integer` setting must be some sort of integer. (default: `nil`)

  ###### `:type`

  `:string` (default) or one of the other types that implement [[get-value-of-type]] and [[set-value-of-type]].
  Non-`:string` Settings have special default getters and setters that automatically coerce values to the correct
  types.

  ###### `:visibility`

  `:public`, `:authenticated`, `:admin` (default), or `:internal`. Controls where this setting is visible

  ###### `:getter`

  A custom getter fn, which takes no arguments. Overrides the default implementation. (This can in turn call functions
  in this namespace like methods of [[get-value-of-type]] to invoke the 'parent' getter behavior.)

  ###### `:setter`

  A custom setter fn, which takes a single argument, or `:none` for read-only settings. Overrides the default
  implementation. (This can in turn call methods of [[set-value-of-type!]] to invoke 'parent' setter behavior. Keep in
  mind that the custom setter may be passed `nil`, which should clear the values of the Setting.)

  ###### `:cache?`

  Should this Setting be cached? (default `true`)? Be careful when disabling this, because it could have a very
  negative performance impact.

  ###### `:sensitive?`

  Is this a sensitive setting, such as a password, that we should never return in plaintext? (Default: `false`).
  Obfuscation is not done by getter functions, but instead by functions that ultimately return these values via the
  API, such as [[admin-writable-settings]] below. (In other words, code in the backend can continute to consume
  sensitive Settings normally; sensitivity is a purely user-facing option.)

  ###### `:database-local`

  The ability of this Setting to be /Database-local/. Valid values are `:only`, `:allowed`, and `:never`. Default:
  `:never`. See docstring for [[metabase.models.setting]] for more information.

  ###### `:deprecated`

  If this setting is deprecated, this should contain a string of the Metabase version in which the setting was
  deprecated. A deprecation notice will be logged whenever the setting is written. (Default: `nil`)."
