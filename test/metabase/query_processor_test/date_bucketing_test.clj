(ns metabase.query-processor-test.date-bucketing-test
  "The below tests cover the various date bucketing/grouping scenarios that we support. There are are always two
  timezones in play when querying using these date bucketing features. The most visible is how timestamps are returned
  to the user. With no report timezone specified, the JVM's timezone is used to represent the timestamps regardless of
  timezone of the database. Specifying a report timezone (if the database supports it) will return the timestamps in
  that timezone (manifesting itself as an offset for that time). Using the JVM timezone that doesn't match the
  database timezone (assuming the database doesn't support a report timezone) can lead to incorrect results.

  The second place timezones can impact this is calculations in the database. A good example of this is grouping
  something by day. In that case, the start (or end) of the day will be different depending on what timezone the
  database is in. The start of the day in pacific time is 7 (or 8) hours earlier than UTC. This means there might be a
  different number of results depending on what timezone we're in. Report timezone lets the user specify that, and it
  gets pushed into the database so calculations are made in that timezone.

  If a report timezone is specified and the database supports it, the JVM timezone should have no impact on queries or
  their results."
