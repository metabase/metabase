# Data Studio

![Data Studio](./images/data-studio.png)

Use the tools in Data Studio to reshape your data to match how people think about your business, and to track your data as it flows from table to report so everyone can trust the numbers.

- **Create an easy-to-understand semantic layer** to keep things accurate and consistent across dashboards, agentic BI, and automated workflows.
- **Speed up queries**. Transform tables to match usage patterns, and precompute common views of your data.
- **Identify and fix data problems**. By keeping all of your computation in one place, you can track how data flows through your Metabase and identify broken logic and schema drifts before they impact reports.

To enter Data Studio, click the grid icon in the top right, and select **Data Studio**.

## What's in Data Studio

- **[Library](./library.md)**\*: A curated space for your organization's most trusted analytics content—tables, metrics, and SQL snippets that your data team recommends.
- Data structures. Curate table metadata to make tables easier to work with.
- Glossary. Define terms relevant to your business, both for people and agents trying to understand your data.
- **[Dependency graph](./dependency-graph.md)**\*: A visual map of how your content connects, so you can understand the impact of changes before you make them.
- Dependency diagnostics\*. See which items have broken dependencies, or that aren't used.
- Transforms
