# Embedding overview

## [Introduction](./introduction.md)

What is embedding, and how does it work?

## [Interactive embedding](./interactive-embedding.md)

The solution to self-service customer analytics: embed the full Metabase app in your app. Interactive embedding integrates with your data permissions to let people slice and dice data on their own using Metabase's query builder.

## [Interactive embedding quick start](./interactive-embedding-quick-start-guide.md)

You'll embed the full Metabase application in your app. Once logged in, people can view a Metabase dashboard in your web app, and be able to use the full Metabase application to explore their data, and only their data.

## [Static embedding](./static-embedding.md)

Also known as Signed Embedding, Static embedding is a secure way to embed charts and dashboards. Static embeds are view only; people won't be able to drill-through charts and tables.

## [Parameters for static embeds](./static-embedding-parameters.md)

You can pass parameters between Metabase and your website via the embedding URL to specify how Metabase items should look and behave inside the iframe on your website.

## [Public embeds](../questions/sharing/public-links.md)

You can also create unsecured public links or embeds of questions and dashboards.
