  "Clojure-land data migration definitions and fns for running them.
  Data migrations are run once when Metabase is first launched.
  Note that there is no locking mechanism for data-migration - thus upon launching Metabase, It's possible
  for a migration to be run multiple times (e.g: when running multiple Metabase instances).

  That said, these migrations should be idempotent, e.g:
     CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ... -- Good
     CREATE TABLE ...               -- Bad"

  reshapen dashcard.  scour for all links in the card, fixup the dashcard and then merge in any new click_behaviors
  from the card. See extensive tests for different scenarios.
