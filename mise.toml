# Metabase Development Environment
# =================================
#
# This file defines the tools required for Metabase development.
# We use mise (https://mise.jdx.dev) to manage tool versions consistently
# across all development machines.
#
# Getting started:
# 1. Run: ./bin/dev-install
#
# The install script handles all the setup.
# This will install mise, configure your shell, and set up all required tools.
#
# IDE/Editor users (not cd'd into the repo):
# ------------------------------------------
# If your workflow doesn't involve cd'ing into the repo (e.g., Emacs server,
# IDE running commands with absolute paths), you have three options:
#
#   1. Use mise shims (recommended for IDEs):
#      Add ~/.local/share/mise/shims to your PATH instead of using `mise activate`.
#      Shims determine the correct tool version at runtime based on the command's
#      working directory.
#
#   2. Use the -C flag to specify the project directory:
#      mise exec -C /path/to/metabase -- bun run build
#
#   3. Set MISE_PROJECT_DIR environment variable:
#      MISE_PROJECT_DIR=/path/to/metabase bun run build
#
#  For more info, see: docs/developers-guide/devenv.md > 'IDE and editor setup' Section
