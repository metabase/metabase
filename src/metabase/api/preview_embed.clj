  "Endpoints for previewing how Cards and Dashboards will look when embedding them.
   These endpoints are basically identical in functionality to the ones in `/api/embed`, but:

   1.  Require admin access
   2.  Ignore the values of `:enabled_embedding` for Cards/Dashboards
   3.  Ignore the `:embed_params` whitelist for Card/Dashboards, instead using a field called `:_embedding_params` in
       the JWT token itself.

   Refer to the documentation for those endpoints for further details."
