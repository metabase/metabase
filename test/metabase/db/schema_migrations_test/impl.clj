  "Tests for the schema migrations defined in the Liquibase YAML files. The basic idea is:

  1. Create a temporary H2/Postgres/MySQL/MariaDB database
  2. Run all migrations up to a certain point
  3. Load some arbitrary data
  4. run migration(s) after that point (verify that they actually run)
  5. verify that data looks like what we'd expect after running migration(s)

  Actual tests using this code live in `metabase.db.schema-migrations-test`."

(defmacro test-migrations
  "Util macro for running tests for a set of Liquibase schema migration(s).

  Before invoking body, migrations up to `start-id` are automatically ran. In body, you should do the following in
  this order:

  1. Load data and check any preconditions before running migrations you're testing.
     Prefer [[toucan.db/simple-insert!]] or plain SQL for loading data to avoid dependencies on the current state of
     the schema that may be present in Toucan `pre-insert` functions and the like.

  2. Call `(migrate!)` to run migrations in range of `start-id` -> `end-id` (inclusive)

  3. Check any postconditions after running the migrations.

  e.g.

    ;; example test for migrations 100-105
    (test-migrations [100 105] [migrate!]
      ;; (Migrations 1-99 are ran automatically before body is invoked)
      ;; 1. Load data
      (create-some-users!)
      ;; 2. Run migrations 100-105
      (migrate!)
      ;; 3. Do some test assertions
      (is (= ...)))

  For convenience `migration-range` can be either a range of migrations IDs to test (e.g. `[100 105]`) or just a
  single migration ID (e.g. `100`).

  These run against the current set of test `DRIVERS` (by default H2), so if you want to run against more than H2
  either set the `DRIVERS` env var or use [[mt/set-test-drivers!]] from the REPL."
