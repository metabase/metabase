If you come across something that looks like a bug, we suggest collecting the following information to help us reproduce the issue.

1. Server logs
2. Javascript console logs
3. Can it be reproduced on the sample dataset?
4. Your Metabase version
5. Where Metabase is running (Docker image, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, etc)
6. What browser version

## Helpful tidbits

### Accessing the Metabase server logs
While you can always look for the logs Metabase leaves on your server file system (or however you collect logs), if you are logged into Metabase with an admin account, you can also access them from the drop down menu in the upper right hand corner.
