(defmacro defenterprise
  "Defines a function that has separate implementations between the Metabase Community Edition (aka OSS) and
  Enterprise Edition (EE).

  When used in a OSS namespace, defines a function that should have a corresponding implementation in an EE namespace
  (using the same macro). The EE implementation will be used preferentially to the OSS implementation if it is available.
  The first argument after the function name should be a symbol of the namespace containing the EE implementation. The
  corresponding EE function must have the same name as the OSS function.

  When used in an EE namespace, the namespace of the corresponding OSS implementation does not need to be included --
  it will be inferred automatically, as long as a corresponding [[defenterprise]] call exists in an OSS namespace.

  Two additional options can be defined, when using this macro in an EE namespace. These options should be defined
  immediately before the args list of the function:

  ###### `:feature`

  A keyword representing a premium feature which must be present for the EE implementation to be used. Use `:none` to
  always run the EE implementation if available, regardless of token (WARNING: this is not recommended for most use
  cases. You probably want to gate your code by a specific premium feature.)

  ###### `:fallback`

  The keyword `:oss`, or a function representing the fallback mechanism which should be used if the instance does not
  have the premium feature defined by the :feature option. If a function is provided, it will be called with the same
  args as the EE function. If `:oss` is provided, it causes the OSS implementation of the function to be called.
  (Default: `:oss`)"
