# Cumulative count and sum

Cumulative count computes the additive total count of rows across a breakout. Cumulative sum computes the rolling sum (also known as running total) of a column across a breakout.

## Syntax

You can use the predefined "Cumulative count" and "Cumulative sum" metrics, or a custom expression:

```
CumulativeCount
```

```
CumulativeSum(column)
```

Cumulative metrics can only be used in the query builder's **Summarize** step â€” you can't use cumulative metrics to create a custom column or filter.

## How cumulative metrics are computed

Under the hood, cumulative metrics is computed in three steps:

1. Group records using the breakout from the **Group by** block.
2. Count the rows in each group.
3. For each group, compute the cumulative total of the counts in all previous groups, including the current group.

Because cumulative metrics use values from previous rows, the sort order in the breakout column matters.

For example, if you have a table with data grouped by month, Metabase will compute the cumulative count like this:

| Month    | `Count` | `CumulativeCount` |
| -------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| July     | 5       | 5                 |
| November | 4       | 5+4 = 9           |
| March    | 2       | 5 + 4 + 2 = 11    |

If the sort is changed (while values remain the same), then the cumulative count changes as well:

| Month    | `Count` | `CumulativeCount` |
| -------- | ------- | ----------------- |
| March    | 2       | 2                 |
| July     | 5       | 2 + 5 = 7         |
| November | 4       | 2 + 5 + 4 = 11    |

When you have only one breakout in the query, Metabase will sort the data by the breakout column in ascending order (using the logic that your database uses for the column's data type). You can add a **Sort** block by the breakout column to change how Metabase accumulates the metric.

## Cumulative metrics with multiple breakouts

Because cumulative metrics calculate its summaries based on previous rows, Metabase needs to determine what those previous rows are. Metabase will decide how to compute and display the cumulative metric based on whether you're grouping by a datetime column, and on the order of other breakouts:

### Queries with a datetime dimension

If you use datetime dimension in the **Group by** block, Metabase will always accumulate along the datetime dimension and break out by any other fields in the **Group by** block (in the order in which the other breakout fields are specified in the **Group by** block):

![Cumulative count by category, source, and created at](../../images/cumulative-date-category.png)

If there are multiple datetime dimensions, including multiple groupings by the same datetime column, Metabase will accumulate along the dimension with the lowest granularity, regardless of the order in which the breakouts are specified. For example, if you're grouping by "Created At: Month" and "Viewed At: Week", Metabase will accumulate along "Viewed At: Week".

Because for queries with a datetime dimension, the accumulation will always be along the datetime dimension, any additional **Sort** blocks for non-datetime fields will only affect the order of breakouts in the results and won't affect how the results are computed.

### Queries without datetime dimension

If there is no datetime field in the **Group by** block, Metabase will accumulate along the _last_ dimension specified in the **Group By** block, and break out by the other fields (in the order in which they are specified).

![Cumulative count by two categorical dimensions](../../images/cumulative-no-datetime.png)

By default, Metabase will use ascending sort for the dimension used for accumulation. You can add a **Sort** block for the accumulation dimension to change the order (this will change both how the cumulative metric is computed and how results are presented).

![Cumulative count by two categorical dimensions with order of accumulation changed](../../images/cumulative-no-datetime-order.png)

**Sort** by any field other than the last (accumulation) field will only affect the order of breakouts in the results, and will not affect how the results are computed.

### Cumulative count in SQL

In SQL, you can use window functions to compute cumulative metrics. For example, to compute cumulative count of orders over months, you can use the following query:

```sql
SELECT
  created_month,
  SUM(count(*)) OVER (
    ORDER BY
      created_month ASC ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
  ) AS "sum"
FROM
  (
    SELECT
      quantity,
      DATE_TRUNC ('month', created_at) AS created_month
    FROM
      orders
  )
GROUP BY
  created_month
ORDER BY
  created_month ASC
```

### Cumulative sums in SQL

For cumulative sums, you can use:

```sql
SELECT
  created_month,
  SUM(SUM(quantity)) OVER (
    ORDER BY
      created_month ASC ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING
  ) AS "sum"
FROM
  (
    SELECT
      quantity,
      DATE_TRUNC ('month', created_at) AS created_month
    FROM
      orders
  )
GROUP BY
  created_month
ORDER BY
  created_month ASC
```
