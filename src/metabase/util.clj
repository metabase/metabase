  does what you'd expect, but when the default locale is Turkish, all hell breaks loose:

    ;; Locale is Turkish / -Duser.language=tr
    (.toUpperCase \"filename\") ;; -> \"FİLENAME\"

  Rather than submit PRs to every library in the world to use `(.toUpperCase <str> Locale/US)`, it's simpler just to
  temporarily bind the default Locale to something predicatable (i.e. US English) when doing something important that
  tends to break like running Liquibase migrations.)

  Note that because `Locale/setDefault` and `Locale/getDefault` aren't thread-local (as far as I know) I've had to put
  a lock in place to prevent race conditions where threads simulataneously attempt to fetch and change the default
  Locale. Thus this macro should be used sparingly, and only in places that are already single-threaded (such as the
  launch code that runs Liquibase).

  DO NOT use this macro in API endpoints or other places that are multithreaded or performance will be negatively
  impacted. (You shouldn't have a good reason for using this there anyway. Rewrite your code to pass `Locale/US` when
  you call `.toUpperCase` or `str/upper-case`. Only use this macro if the calls in question are part of a 3rd-party
