# Does Metabase have access to my company's data?

If you run Metabase as a self-hosted instance, none of your data is collected or stored on Metabase servers.

There is the option to opt-in to sharing anonymous usage data with us, which we use to make decisions about product improvements. This option is turned off by default, and you can read more about it [here](../../information-collection.html).
