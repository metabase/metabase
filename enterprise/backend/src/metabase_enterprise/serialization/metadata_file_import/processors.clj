(ns metabase-enterprise.serialization.metadata-file-import.processors
  "SQL building blocks for the metadata file importer's drain-then-merge flow.

  Three groups of functions:

    - **Phase 1 (databases)**: [[process-databases!]] — per-batch in-Clojure match.
      No live writes; returns a `{:source-id :target-id :status}` eduction.
    - **Drain**: [[drain-tables-into-staging!]] / [[drain-fields-into-staging!]] —
      stream the file into `metabase_table_import` / `metabase_field_import`.
      Decompose portable ids into staging columns. No live writes.
    - **Merge** (atomic, designed to compose under one outer `t2/with-transaction`):
      [[merge-tables!]], [[insert-stubs-where-not-exists!]],
      [[resolve-existing-parents-in-staging!]], [[assert-no-unresolved-parent-refs!]],
      [[merge-fields-pass-1!]], [[merge-fields-pass-2!]],
      [[resolve-fk-target-ids-in-staging!]],
      [[assert-no-unresolved-fk-targets!]], [[merge-fk-targets!]],
      [[warn-on-orphan-staging-rows!]].

  Convention-blind: portable ids are treated as opaque match keys. Driver-blind:
  every SQL statement goes through `t2/query` with a HoneySQL map; correlated
  subqueries instead of `UPDATE … FROM` for cross-dialect portability.

  Errors propagate as `ex-info` with `:kind` for typed failure handling
  (`:invalid_input`, `:stub_resolution_invalidated`, `:fk_target_unresolved`)."

(defn merge-tables!
  "Merge `metabase_table_import` into `metabase_table` atomically.

  Two SQL statements wrapped in a single `t2/with-transaction`:

    1. **UPDATE** rows whose `target_id` resolved (i.e., a matching active
       live row exists). Clobbers `description` from staging, bumps
       `updated_at`. Each SET column is a single-key lookup on
       `staging.target_id`.
    2. **INSERT** rows whose `target_id` is NULL — no active live row
       matched. Sets `active=true` and `data_layer='internal'`; lets column
       defaults handle `field_order`, `initial_sync_status`, etc.

  Order matters: UPDATE first so on a clean-schema import the UPDATE matches
  nothing (fast no-op) and the INSERT writes each row exactly once.

  Pre-condition: [[resolve-target-table-ids-in-staging!]] must have run.
  Without that, every staging row's `target_id` is NULL — you'd get correct
  INSERTs but no clobber.

  The INSERT JOINs `metabase_database` on `db_name`, so staging rows whose
  source DB has no target appdb match are silently dropped.

  The `set-new-table-permissions!` `:after-insert` hook on `:model/Table` does
  not fire here because the INSERT goes through the raw table keyword
  (`:metabase_table`) rather than the model. This preserves today's
  per-table-permission gap; batched-grant work is tracked separately.

  Composes safely inside a larger transaction: Toucan2's `t2/with-transaction`
  joins an outer txn rather than creating a savepoint, so when an outer caller
  wraps several merge steps in one txn, this function's inner txn participates
  in the outer's all-or-nothing semantics."

  no-progress round (which signals a cycle in the file's reference graph).

  Throws `:cycle_in_field_graph` if any rows remain untagged after the loop
  exits — the strict-consistency invariant from `assert-no-orphan-refs!`
  guarantees this can only happen via a cycle (e.g., X.parent_id = Y AND
  Y.parent_id = X).

  Pre-condition: [[assert-no-orphan-refs!]] must have run successfully. Without
  the strict-consistency guarantee, the cycle vs. orphan distinction breaks
  down (a row whose parent doesn't exist in the file would also be untagged,
  but for a different reason).

  Returns the maximum depth currently in staging (queried after tagging
  completes). This is idempotent — re-running on already-tagged staging
  returns the same max depth. Useful for the depth-walk merge to know how
  many levels to iterate."

  "Merge non-FK staging rows into `metabase_field` atomically, in two SQL

  `fi.fk_target_db_name IS NULL`.

    1. **UPDATE** rows whose `target_field_id` resolved AND whose staging row
       has no FK. Clobbers the seven payload columns (`base_type`,
       `database_type`, `description`, `effective_type`, `semantic_type`,
       `coercion_strategy`, `nfc_path`), sets `active=true` (flips stubs to
       live), bumps `updated_at`. Each SET column is a single-key lookup on
       `staging.target_field_id`. Skip-if-unchanged: the EXISTS subquery
       additionally requires that at least one observable column differs.
    2. **INSERT** rows whose `target_field_id` is NULL AND whose staging row
       has no FK. Sets `active=true`, `is_defective_duplicate=false`,
       `fk_target_field_id=NULL`.

  Order matters: UPDATE first so on a clean-schema import the UPDATE matches
  nothing (fast no-op) and the INSERT writes each row exactly once.

  Pre-condition: `resolve-target-field-ids-in-staging!` must have run (the
  orchestrator does this just before calling this fn).

  After Pass 1 lands, every non-FK staging row exists in `metabase_field`. The
  orchestrator then re-resolves `target_field_id` (round 2) and resolves
  `fk_target_id` against `metabase_field` — for FK staging rows whose target
  is non-FK (the common case) this picks up the just-inserted target rows so
  Pass 2 can carry the resolved id through the INSERT/UPDATE.

    1. **UPDATE** rows whose `target_field_id` resolved AND whose staging row
       has an FK. Clobbers the seven payload columns AND `fk_target_field_id`
       (from `staging.fk_target_id`). Skip-if-unchanged predicate includes
       `fk_target_field_id` in the change check (compared NULL-safely with
       `COALESCE(., 0)` since 0 is never a valid id).
    2. **INSERT** rows whose `target_field_id` is NULL AND whose staging row
       has an FK. `fk_target_field_id` is set in the INSERT from
       `staging.fk_target_id` — no separate UPDATE pass needed for the
       common case (FK target was non-FK and got resolved between Pass 1 and
       Pass 2). For FK chain cases where the target is itself a Pass-2 row,
       `staging.fk_target_id` may still be NULL at INSERT time, so the
       column lands NULL and the orchestrator's final `merge-fk-targets!`
       cleanup fills it in.

  Pre-conditions:
    - Pass 1 has run (so non-FK rows exist in `metabase_field`).
    - `resolve-target-field-ids-in-staging!` ran after Pass 1 (so newly-
      inserted non-FK rows have their `target_field_id` populated, useful when
      another FK row points at them).
    - `resolve-fk-target-ids-in-staging!` ran after Pass 1 (so `fk_target_id`
      is populated for FK rows whose target exists by now).
