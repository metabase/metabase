(ns metabase.plugins.classloader
  "Logic for getting and setting the context classloader we'll use for loading Metabase plugins. Use `the-classloader`
  to get the Classloader you should use with calls to `Class/forName`; call it for side effects to ensure the current
  thread context classloader will have access to JARs we add at runtime before calling `require`.

  The classloader is guaranteed to be an instance of `DynamicClassLoader`, which means we can add URLs to it at
  runtime with dynapath; use `add-url-to-classpath!` to add URLs to the classpath to make sure they are added to the
  correct classloader.

  If you are unfamiliar with ClassLoaders in general, I found this article pretty helpful:
  https://www.javaworld.com/article/2077344/core-java/find-a-way-out-of-the-classloader-maze.html.
