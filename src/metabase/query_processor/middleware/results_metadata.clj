   Results metadata is returned as part of all query results, with the hope that the frontend will pass it back to
   us when a Card is saved or updated. This checksum (also passed) is a simple way for us to check whether the metadata
   is valid and hasn't been accidentally tampered with.

   By default, this is not cryptographically secure, nor is it meant to be. Of course, a bad actor could alter the
   metadata and return a new, correct checksum. But intentionally saving bad metadata would only help in letting you
   write bad queries; the field literals can only refer to columns in the original 'source' query at any rate, so you
   wouldn't, for example, be able to give yourself access to columns in a different table.

   However, if `MB_ENCRYPTION_SECRET_KEY` is set, we'll go ahead and use it to encypt the checksum so it becomes it
   becomes impossible to alter the metadata and produce a correct checksum at any rate."
