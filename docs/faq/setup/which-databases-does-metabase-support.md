# Which databases does Metabase support?

See [our list of officially supported databases](../../administration-guide/01-managing-databases.md#officially-supported-databases).

You may find some [community-built database drivers](../../developers-guide-drivers.md) for databases that we do not currently support - and you are always welcome to build your own!
