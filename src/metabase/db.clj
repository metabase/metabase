   connect to the Metabase database, in which case we'd like to allow connections to databases that don't exist.

   So we need some way to distinguish the Metabase database from other databases. We could add a key to the details map
   specifying that it's the Metabase DB, but what if some shady user added that key to another database?

   We could check if a database details map matched `db-connection-details` above, but what if a shady user went Meta-Metabase
   and added the Metabase DB to Metabase itself? Then when they used it they'd have potentially unsafe access.

   So this is where dynamic variables come to the rescue. We'll make this one `true` when we use `can-connect?` for the
   Metabase DB, in which case we'll allow connection to non-existent H2 (etc.) files, and leave it `false` happily and

  ENTITY may be either an entity like `User` or a vector like `[entity & field-keys]`.
  If just an entity is passed, `sel` will return `default-fields` for ENTITY.

  ENTITY may optionally be a fully-qualified symbol name of an entity; in this case, the symbol's namespace

  dependencies. This is slower, however, due to added runtime overhead.

  clauses](http://www.sqlkorma.com/docs#select) such as `order`, which are passed directly.
