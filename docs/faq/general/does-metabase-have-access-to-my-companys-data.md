# Does Metabase have access to my company's data?

If you run Metabase as a self-hosted instance, none of your data is collected or stored on Metabase servers. That said, you *can* opt in to share anonymous usage data with us, which helps us make decisions about product improvements. You can read more about it [here][data-collection].
