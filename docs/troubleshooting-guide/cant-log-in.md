# People can't log in to Metabase

## No access to Metabase login page

If you're not a Metabase admin, you'll have to tag them for help here.

1. Check that you have the correct [site URL](../configuring-metabase/settings.md) from **Settings** > **Admin settings** > **General**.
3. Check if the [account is deactivated](../people-and-groups/managing.md#deactivating-an-account).

## No access to Metabase Cloud account

The admin password for `store.metabase.com` (where you can find payment and subscription info) is not necessarily the same as the password for your Metabase instance (where you log in to look at data).

If you've forgotten your Metabase Cloud admin password, you can [contact support](https://www.metabase.com/help-premium) to reset the password.
