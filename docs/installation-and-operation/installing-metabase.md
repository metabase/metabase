# Installing Metabase

Metabase is built and packaged as a Java JAR file and can be run anywhere that Java is available.

## Metabase Cloud (Recommended)

[Metabase Cloud](https://www.metabase.com/cloud) is the easiest way to run Metabase. All you need to do is [sign up for a free trial](https://store.metabase.com/checkout), and you're off to the races.

## Self-hosting Metabase

For an overview on how to self-host Metabase, check out [how to run Metabase in production](https://www.metabase.com/learn/metabase-basics/administration/administration-and-operation/metabase-in-production).

### Running on Docker (Recommended for self-hosting)

Run Metabase in a [Docker container](./running-metabase-on-docker.md).

### Running the Jar file

If you're self-hosting but don’t use Docker, the JAR is the easiest way to get started, but it might make it more challenging to move to production. See [running the Metabase Jar](./running-the-metabase-jar-file.md).

## Air-gapped Metabase

If you're self-hosting because you need an air-gapped environment, check out the [air-gapped edition of Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/product/air-gapping).
