;; # Google Sheets Integration
;;
;; ## Overview
;; Google Sheets Integration allows users to connect their Google Drive folders to Metabase. We sync any Google Sheets
;; inside of those folders, and make them available to the user in their attached data warehouse. This integration is
;; implemented using Harbormaster, which is a service that manages instances of Metabase and also gives us a connection
;; to Google Sheets data. When a user connects a Google Drive folder to Metabase, Harbormaster creates a connection to
;; the folder and starts syncing the data to Metabase. This data is then available to the user in Metabase as tables.
;;
;; ## Steps to connect a new google drive folder
;;
;; - An admin clicks Add Data > Connect Google Sheets
;; - FE sends :get "api/ee/gsheets/service-account" to get service-account email
;;   - If the FE cannot find the service-account email, it does not show the "connect to google sheets" (ctgs) button.
;; - user clicks ctgs button -> FE shows instructions for how to connect a folder:
;;   - user shares their Google Drive folder w/ service-account email
;;   - user copies their Google Drive share link into MB form and hits submit
;; - FE sends :post "api/ee/gsheets/folder" w/ folder url string as `request.body.url`
;;   - BE forwards request to :post "/api/v2/mb/connections" w/ body:
;;     `{:type "[gdrive|google_spreadsheet]" :secret {:resources ["the-url"]}}`
;;     - on unexceptional status:
;;       - BE returns the gsheets shape: `{:status "syncing" :url "the-url" :created_at <epoch-time>}}`
;;     - on exceptional status, BE returns a message like: "Unable to set up drive folder sync. Please check that the
;;       folder is shared with the proper service account email and sharing permissions."
;;
;; ## Polling
;; - FE polls :get "api/ee/gsheets/connection" until `body.status` == `active`
;; - BE forwards requests to :get "/api/v2/mb/connection/<gdrive-conn-id>", filtering for the google drive connection
;;   - If the connection doesn't exist: `{:error "google drive connection not found."}`
;;   - If the connection exists, return connection state in the response
;; - FE sees status == "active" or "syncing" and updates the UI accordingly, stopping polling when it sees "active"
;;
;; ## Steps to disconnect a google drive folder
;; - FE sends request to :delete "/connection"
;;   - MB loops over all gdrive connection ids and deletes them
;;
;; ## Why do we need to sync the attached datawarehouse before considering it ready?
;; We need to sync the attached datawarehouse to make sure that the data from the Google Drive folder is available to
;; the user in Metabase. Once the gdrive connection's status is set to 'active' by HM, they will call MB's
;; `api/notify/db/attached_datawarehouse` endpoint to trigger a sync. The data from the Google Drive folder is already
;; availiable in the attached datawarehouse, and when MB finishes the sync (and puts an item into :model/TaskHistory
;; saying so), the user can start using their Google Sheets data in Metabase.
;;
;; ## Why do we check for multiple gdrive connections in the delete endpoint? We check for multiple gdrive connections
;; in the delete endpoint to make sure that we are deleting _all_ gdrive connections. As of Milestone 2 there is
;; supposed to be only one gdrive connection, but we observed multiple being created (distributed systems amirite?) and
;; want the delete endpoint to basically reset us to a blank slate. If there are multiple gdrive connections, we will
;; delete all of them. If there are errors during the gdrive conn deletion we ignore them.
