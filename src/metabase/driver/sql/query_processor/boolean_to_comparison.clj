  "In SQL Server and some other databases, boolean literals cannot appear in the top-level of WHERE clauses or
  expressions like AND, OR, NOT, and CASE. These instead require a comparison operator, so boolean constants like 0
  and 1 must be replaced with equivalent expressions like 1 = 1 or 0 = 1.

  Drivers can call boolean->comparison to convert boolean literals and refs into comparison expressions. See the
  sqlserver or oracle drivers for examples."

;; Oracle and SQLServer (and maybe others) use 0 and 1 for boolean constants, but, for example, none of the following
;; queries are valid in such databases:
;;
;; - SELECT 1 WHERE 1
;; - SELECT 1 WHERE 1 AND 1
;; - SELECT CASE WHEN 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
;;
;; But these are:
;;
;; - SELECT 1 WHERE (1 = 1)
;; - SELECT 1 WHERE (1 = 1) AND (1 = 1)
;; - SELECT CASE WHEN (1 = 1) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
