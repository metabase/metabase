summary: Metabase syncs data types from your database to know the type of each column. In addition to base data types, you can set a semantic type to tell Metabase what that data actually means. Choosing the right field types helps Metabase choose the right format and visualization for your data.

# Data and field types

Metabase distinguishes between two types of column metadata: data types and field types.

- [**Data types**](#data-types) are the underlying column type as defined in your database. Metabase reads the data types during the [database sync process](../databases/sync-scan.md).
- [**Semantic types**](#semantic-types), also called **field types**, are labels that describe how the data should be interpreted. For example, a column can have a data type of `Text`, that you can additionally specify the semantic type `Email`.

Data and semantic types determine how Metabase formats the data, which charts are available, how the filters work, and other functionality.

## Data types

Data types are the underlying column types as defined in your database. Metabase reads the data types during the [database sync process](../databases/sync-scan.md). Because Metabase connects to many different databases, it uses its own type hierarchy under the hood, so that it could offer the same functionality for, for example, date fields in MongoDB or PostgreSQL

The main data types in Metabase:

| Data Type  | Example database types                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Numeric    | `INTEGER`, `FLOAT`                          |
| Temporal   | `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`                         |
| Text       | `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`                           |
| Text-like  | MongoDB `BSONID`, Postgres `Enum`           |
| Boolean    | Boolean                                     |
| Collection | `JSON`, BigQuery `RECORD`, MongoDB `Object` |

Metabase currently does not support array types with any database. You'll only be able to use **Is empty** or **Is not empty** filters on columns containing arrays.

For some fields, you tell Metabase to [cast them to a different data type](#editing-data-and-semantic-types) (for example, text to date).

## Semantic types

Semantic types are extra flavor that you can add to a field to communicate meaning and enable [additional functionality](#additional-functionality-for-data-and-semantic-types). Available semantic types depend on the underlying data types.

### Semantic types for any field

- Entity key

  Used to indicate that the field uniquely identifies each row. Could be a Product ID, serial number, etc.

- Foreign key

  Used to refer to an Entity key of another table in order to connect data from different tables that are related. For example, in a Products table, you might have a Customer ID field that points to a Customers table, where Customer ID is the Entity key. If you want to use [linked filters on dashboards](../dashboards/linked-filters.md), you must set up foreign key relationships.

  See [Working with JSON](./json-unfolding.md).

## Editing data and semantic types

Admins and people with [Manage table metadata permissions](../permissions/data.md#manage-table-metadata-permissions) can cast data types and edit semantic types in Admin Table Metadata settings.

### Cast data types

Data types can't be edited in Metabase directly, but certain data types can be [cast to different types types](./metadata-editing.md#casting-to-a-specific-data-type) to be read differently, like interpreting a numerical data type as a date format.

Changes made in Table Metadata apply across your entire Metabase. Metabase currently only supports casting to a datetime type in Metadata settings. However, if you you build a query in the query builder, in you can use type casting custom expressions like [`date()`](../questions/query-builder/expressions-list.md#date) or [`integer()`](../questions/query-builder/expressions-list.md#integer) to cast a string to a different type in your query.

### Semantic types don't change the data types

You can pick a semantic type compatible with the underlying data type in [table metadata settings](./metadata-editing.md#field-types)

Semantic types add meaning shouldn't be used for type casting. For example, picking a semantic type of "Quantity" for a text field will not force Metabase to treat the field as numeric. Use Semantic types to add additional functionality for your fields, like formatting or visualizations.

## What data and semantic types enable

### Display format

Some semantic types change the way the data in the field is displayed.

Formatting setting from Table Metadata settings will be applied across your Metabase, but people can change them for individual charts.

| Semantic type          | Format                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Percentage             | Displayed as percentage, for example 0.75 will be displayed as 75\%                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Currency               | On charts and in detail view, the values are prepended by the currency symbol, e.g. `$134.65`. In table view, the currency symbol is only displayed in the header by default, but you can change the metadata formatting settings to show the symbol on every row. |
| Latitude/Longitude     | Displayed as coordinates, e.g. `0.00000000Â° N`                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Email                  | Display as a `mailto` link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| URL                    | Can format as a clickable link                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Image URL              | Can display as an image. See table format settings LINK                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Avatar URL             | Can display as avatar circle image. See table format settings LINK                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Field containing JSON  | In detail view, display as prettified JSON                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Entity and Foreign key | Highlighted in table view                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

### Visualizations

When you build a query in the query builder, Metabase will automatically choose the most suitable chart for you based on the data types and the semantic types of the field in the "Group by" (you can change the chart type later).

| Group by data type   | Automatic chart |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| Text/Category        | Bar chart       |
| Temporal             | Line chart      |
| Numeric - binned     | Bar chart       |
| Numeric - not binned | Table           |
| Boolean              | Bar chart       |
| No aggregation       | Table           |

Additionally, if you use location semantic types:

| Group by semantic type          | Functionality            |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Latitude/Longitude - binned     | Grid map                 |
| Latitude/longitude - not binned | Pin map                  |
| Country                         | World region map         |
| State                           | United States region map |

### Extract values from columns

For some fields, you can quickly extract values from columns using shortcuts in table view or in the custom expression editor in the query builder:

| Group by data type  | Extract                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| URL semantic types  | Extract host, domain, subdomain, path   |
| Email semantic type | Extract host, domain                    |
| Temporal data types | Extract date parts like month, day, etc |

### X-rays

When you [X-ray](../exploration-and-organization/x-rays.md) a table, model, or entity, Metabase considers both the data type and the field type to display different charts that summarize that data.

### Field Filters

Knowing what field types are and how they work is helpful when using [field filters](https://www.metabase.com/learn/metabase-basics/querying-and-dashboards/sql-in-metabase/field-filters), as you can only create field filters for [certain field types](../questions/native-editor/sql-parameters.md#field-filter-compatible-types).

### JSON unfolding

See [Working with JSON](./json-unfolding.md).

## Set semantic types in models to enable people to explore results with the query builder

You can set field types for [models](./models.md), which helps Metabase understand how to work with data in models built using SQL. If you set each column type in a SQL model, people will be able to explore that model using the query builder and drill-through menus.

With records that include integer entity keys, you can also configure text fields in models to [surface individual records in search](./models.md#surface-individual-records-in-search-by-matching-against-this-column).
