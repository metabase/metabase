;; How does analysis decide which Fields should get analyzed?
;;
;; Good question. There are two situations in which Fields should get analyzed:
;;
;; *  Whenever a new Field is first detected, *or*
;; *  When the fingerprinters are updated in such a way that this Field (based on its base type) ought to be
;; *  re-fingerprinted
;;
;; So how do we check all that?
;;
;; 1.  We keep track of which base types are affected by new fingerprint versions. See the discussion in
;;     `metabase.sync.interface` for more details.
;;
;; 2.  FINGERPRINTING
;;
;;     2a. When running fingerprinting, we calculate a fairly sophisticated SQL query to only fetch Fields that
;;         need to be re-fingerprinted based on type info and their current fingerprint version
;;
;;     2b. All of these fields get updated fingerprints and marked with the newest version. We also set
;;         `last_analyzed` to `nil` so we know we need to re-run classification for them
;;
;; 3.  CLASSIFICATION
;;
;;     All Fields that have the latest fingerprint version but a `nil` `last_analyzed` time need to be re-classified.
;;     Classification takes place for these Fields and semantic types and the like are updated as needed.
;;
;; 4.  MARKING FIELDS AS RECENTLY ANALYZED
;;
;;     Once all of the above is done, we update the `last_analyzed` timestamp for all the Fields that got
;;     re-fingerprinted and re-classified.
;;
;; So what happens during the next analysis?
;;
;; During the next analysis phase, Fields whose fingerprint is up-to-date will be skipped. However, if a new
;; fingerprint version is introduced, Fields that need it will be upgraded to it. We'll still only reclassify the
;; newly re-fingerprinted Fields, because we'll know to skip the ones from last time since their value of
;; `last_analyzed` is not `nil`.
