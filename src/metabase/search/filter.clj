  "Namespace that defines the filters that are applied to the search results.

  There are required filters and optional filters.
  Archived is an required filters and is always applied, the reason because by default we want to hide archived/inactive entities.

  But there are OPTIONAL FILTERS like :created-by, :created-at, when these filters are provided, the results will return only
  results of models that have these filters.

  The multi method for optional filters should have the default implementation to throw for unsupported models, and then each model
  that supports the filter should define its own method for the filter."
