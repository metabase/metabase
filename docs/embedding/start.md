# Embedding overview

## [Introduction](./introduction.md)

What is embedding, and how does it work?

## [Interactive embedding](./interactive-embedding.md)

The solution to self-service customer analytics: embed the full Metabase app in your app. Interactive embedding integrates with your data permissions to let people slice and dice data on their own using Metabase's query builder.

## [Static embedding](./static-embedding.md)

Also known as Signed Embedding, Static embedding offers drill-through with custom destinations, so you can define what happens when people click on a chart, like sending people to another chart or URLâ€“all while securing the underlying data.

## [Parameters for signed embeds](./static-embedding-parameters.md)

You can pass parameters between Metabase and your website via the embedding URL to specify how Metabase items should look and behave inside the iframe on your website.
