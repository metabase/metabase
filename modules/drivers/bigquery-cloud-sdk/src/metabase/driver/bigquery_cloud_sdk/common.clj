  This would require a lot of extra computation/invocation of the Google SDK methods to recalculate this on every query
  (since it will involve parsing this JSON repeatedly), and even using something like `qp.store/cached` functionality
  would still require recomputing it on every query execution.  Because this will only ever change if/when the DB
  details change (i.e. the service account), just calculate it once per change (when the DB is updated, or upon first
  query for a new Database), and store it back to the app DB.
