(ns metabase.agent-lib.representations.repair
  "Repair pass for LLM-authored representations queries.

  Works on the **string-keyed, portable** representations form -- i.e. the output of
  `metabase.agent-lib.representations/parse-yaml` *before* it has been handed to the resolver.
  This is where we gently patch up the sort of shape drift that LLMs routinely produce:

    * missing `{}` options on clauses (LLMs forget to emit empty maps);
    * missing `\"lib/type\"` marker on stages and on the top-level query;
    * (structurally prepared, but Phase-2 feature) resolved-UUID generation for aggregation refs.

  **Key invariant: idempotency.** Repair must be a fixed point under repeated application: for
  any repr `q`, `(repair q)` must equal `(repair (repair q))`. This is enforced by property test
  and by construction -- every pass is written as `when-something-is-missing, add it`, never as
  `rewrite what's there`.

  Phase 1 scope: the three basic passes above. More complex repairs -- placeholder UUID expansion
  for `@agg-N` references (Phase 2 step 10), implicit-join `source-field` inference (Phase 1
  step 6) -- live in follow-up passes that will be composed here once implemented.

  The repair pass does **not** do FK resolution (that's the resolver's job) and does **not**
  validate (that's `representations/validate-query`'s job). It runs *between* parse and
  validate-and-resolve -- i.e. we parse the LLM YAML, repair obvious issues, then validate, then
  resolve."

  ambiguous -- position 2 might be a nested clause (`[\"=\", [\"field\", ...], 10]` where the LLM
  forgot the options on `=`), and replacing that nested clause with `{}` would silently drop
  data. Instead we only repair the two unambiguous cases:

    * clause too short (no position 2 at all): `[\"count\"]` -> `[\"count\" {}]`;
    * explicit nil at position 2: `[\"count\", nil]` -> `[\"count\" {}]`.
