# H2

H2 is a lightweight, in-memory database; itâ€™s perfect for getting spun up quickly, but not so good for long-term usage. By default, Metabase uses H2 to store its internal data. The Sample Database included with Metabase is also an H2 database.

## Avoid using H2 as your application database in production

If you want to run Metabase in production, we recommend that you [migrate off H2](../../installation-and-operation/migrating-from-h2.md).
