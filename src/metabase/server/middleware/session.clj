;; How do authenticated API requests work? Metabase first looks for a cookie called `metabase.SESSION`. This is the
;; normal way of doing things; this cookie gets set automatically upon login. `metabase.SESSION` is an HttpOnly
;; cookie and thus can't be viewed by FE code. If the session is a full-app embedded session, then the cookie is
;; `metabase.EMBEDDED_SESSION` instead.
;;
;; If that cookie is isn't present, we look for the `metabase.SESSION_ID`, which is the old session cookie set in
;; 0.31.x and older. Unlike `metabase.SESSION`, this cookie was set directly by the frontend and thus was not
;; HttpOnly; for 0.32.x we'll continue to accept it rather than logging every one else out on upgrade. (We've
;; switched to a new Cookie name for 0.32.x because the new cookie includes a `path` attribute, thus browsers consider
;; it to be a different Cookie; Ring cookie middleware does not handle multiple cookies with the same name.)
;;
;; Finally we'll check for the presence of a `X-Metabase-Session` header. If that isn't present, you don't have a
;; Session ID and thus are definitely not authenticated
