  "Wrappers for enterprise-only QP middleware using [[defenterprise]]. Pre-processing and post-processing middleware can
  use [[defenterprise]] directly, since the top-level function is applied directly each during each QP run, meaning it
  gets the chance to dispatch correctly every time it is run; 'around' middleware (including 'execution' middleware)
  needs a helper function that invokes the [[defenterprise]] function during every QP run, rather than just once when
  all middleware is combined. See [[handle-audit-app-internal-queries]]
