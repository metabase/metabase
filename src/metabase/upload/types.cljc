;; Upload value-types form a directed acyclic graph where each type can be relaxed into any of its ancestors.
;; We parse each value in the CSV file to the most-specific possible type for each column.

;; The most-specific possible type for a column is the closest common ancestor of the types for each value in the
;; column, found by walking through the graph in topological order, following edges from left to right.
;; Note that this type is not guaranteed to be one of the least common ancestors!
;;
;; See [[metabase.util.ordered-hierarchy/first-common-ancestor]] for more details.

;; We have a number of special "abstract" nodes in this graph:
;;
;; - `*boolean-int*` is an ambiguous node, that could either be parsed as a boolean or as an integer.
;; - `*float-or-int*` is any integer, whether it has an explicit decimal point or not.
;;
;; While a `*boolean-int*` is a genuinely ambiguous value, `*float-or-int*` exist to power our desired value-type
;; coercion and column-type promotion behaviour.
;;
;; - If we encounter a `*float-or-int*` inside an `int` column, then we can safely coerce it down to an integer.
;; - If we encounter a `float` (i.e. a non-zero fraction component), then we need to promote the column to a `float.`
;;
;; Columns can not have an abstract type, which has no meaning outside of inference and reconciliation.
;; If we are left with an abstract type after having processed all the values, we first check whether we can coerce
;; the type to the existing column type, and otherwise traverse further up the graph until we reach a concrete type.
;;
;; For ease of reference and explicitness these corresponding values are given in the `abstract->concrete` map.
;; One can figure out these mappings by simply looking up through the ancestors. For now, we require that it is always
;; a direct ancestor, and lay out or graph so that it is the left-most one.
