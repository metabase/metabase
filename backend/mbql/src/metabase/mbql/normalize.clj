  "Logic for taking any sort of weird MBQL query and normalizing it into a standardized, canonical form. You can think
  of this like taking any 'valid' MBQL query and rewriting it as-if it was written in perfect up-to-date MBQL in the
  latest version. There are four main things done here, done as four separate steps:

  #### NORMALIZING TOKENS

  Converting all identifiers to lower-case, lisp-case keywords. e.g. `{\"SOURCE_TABLE\" 10}` becomes `{:source-table
  10}`.

  #### CANONICALIZING THE QUERY

  Rewriting deprecated MBQL 95/98 syntax and other things that are still supported for backwards-compatibility in
  canonical MBQL 2000 syntax. For example `{:breakout [:count 10]}` becomes `{:breakout [[:count [:field-id 10]]]}`.

  #### WHOLE-QUERY TRANSFORMATIONS

  Transformations and cleanup of the query structure as a whole to fix inconsistencies. Whereas the canonicalization
  phase operates on a lower-level, transforming invidual clauses, this phase focuses on transformations that affect
  multiple clauses, such as removing duplicate references to Fields if they are specified in both the `:breakout` and
  `:fields` clauses.

  This is not the only place that does such transformations; several pieces of QP middleware perform similar
  individual transformations, such as `reconcile-breakout-and-order-by-bucketing`.

  #### REMOVING EMPTY CLAUSES

  Removing empty clauses like `{:aggregation nil}` or `{:breakout []}`.

  Token normalization occurs first, followed by canonicalization, followed by removing empty clauses."
