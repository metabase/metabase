(defmulti options
  "Return the Metabase lib options map associated with an `mbql-clause-or-map`. Lib options is currently used mostly for
  the `:lib/uuid` we attach to everything to facilitate removing or replacing clauses later, but we will probably
  stick more stuff in here in the future. Some clauses like `:field` use options extensively for different things.

  Normally for an MBQL clause, options are an optional second argument, e.g.

    [:= {:lib/uuid \"03baa510-0415-48ef-987a-462d789c8a02\"} 1 2]

  a la Hiccup or Malli. The default implementation already knows how to handle clauses that follow this shape. For
  historic reasons some MBQL clauses like `:field` or some of the string filter clauses have options as the last
  argument; you'll have to implement this method, and [[with-options]], to deal with the special cases.

  For maps like join specs, options are currently stored under the `:lib/options` key. Does this make sense? Not sure.
  Maybe options should be included directly in the map, but then we'd have to decide which keys are and are not
  options. Is a join `:alias` an option? Probably. What about a `:condition`? It's not optional. So for purposes of
  writing Metabase lib and tracking `:lib/uuid`, this approach seems ok in the short term."
