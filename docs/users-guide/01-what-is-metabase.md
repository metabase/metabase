### What is Metabase?
Metabase is an open source business intelligence server.  

It lets you ask questions based on your own data.  Answers are displayed in formats that make sense, whether that's a bar graph or a detailed table.  

You can mark your questions to be saved for later, making it easy to come back to them.  Or you can group questions into visual dashboards.  Metabase makes it easy to share questions and dashboards with the rest of your team. 

To fully understand how to use Metabase it is useful to have at least a high level understanding of databases. We'll discuss [The basics of database terminology](02-database-basics.md) next.
