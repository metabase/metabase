(ns metabase.db
  "High-level functions for setting up the Metabase application database. Additional functions can be found in
  sub-namespaces:

  * [[metabase.db.connection]] - functions for getting the application database type (e.g. `:h2`) and a
    [[clojure.java.jdbc]] spec for it; dynamic variable for rebinding it

  * [[metabase.db.connection-pool-setup]] - functions for creating a connection pool for the application database

  * [[metabase.db.data-migrations]] - Clojure-land data migration definitions and functions for running them

  * [[metabase.db.data-source]] - Implementations of [[javax.sql.DataSource]] for raw connection strings and
    broken-out db details. See [[metabase.db.env/broken-out-details]] for more details about what 'broken-out details'
    means.

  * [[metabase.db.env]] - functions for getting application database connection information from environment variables

  * [[metabase.db.jdbc-protocols]] - implementations of [[clojure.java.jdbc]] protocols for the Metabase application
    database

  * [[metabase.db.liquibase]] - high-level Clojure wrapper around relevant parts of the Liquibase API

  * [[metabase.db.setup]] - code related to setting up the application DB -- verifying the connection and running
    migrations -- and for setting it up as the default Toucan connection

  * [[metabase.db.spec]] - util functions for creating JDBC specs for supported application DB types from connection
    details maps

  * [[metabase.db.util]] - general util functions for Toucan/HoneySQL queries against the application DB"
