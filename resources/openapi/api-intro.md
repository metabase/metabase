- **The API is subject to change.** We rarely change API endpoints, and almost never remove them, but if you write code that relies on the API, there's a chance you might have to update your code in the future.
- **The API isn't versioned.** So don’t expect to stay on a particular version of Metabase in order to use a “stable” API.

## API tutorial

## API keys

Create keys to authenticate programmatic requests to your Metabase. See [API keys](./people-and-groups/api-keys.md).

## API changelog

For breaking changes, see the API [changelog](./developers-guide/api-changelog.md).
