# Embedded analytics SDK - Using the SDK with Next.js

{% include plans-blockquote.html feature="Embedded analytics SDK" sdk=true %}

{% include youtube.html id='UfL8okz36d0' %}

Some notes on using the Embedded analytics SDK with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). The SDK is tested to work with Next.js 14, although it may work with other versions.

See a [sample Next.js app that uses the SDK](https://github.com/metabase/metabase-nextjs-sdk-embedding-sample).

## SDK components with Server Side Rendering (SSR) or React Server Components

The SDK components render only on the client side and not on the server side.

### Compatibility layer for server-side rendering (SSR) (DEPRECATED)

_Note_: Compatibility layer for server-side rendering (SSR) is no more needed and was deprecated. If you use it, change your imports from `@metabase/embedding-sdk-react/next` to `@metabase/embedding-sdk-react`.

## Handling authentication

App Router and Pages Router have different ways to define API routes. If you want to authenticate users from your server with JWT, you can follow the instructions below. But if you want to authenticate with API keys for local development, see [Authenticating locally with API keys](./authentication.md#authenticating-locally-with-api-keys).

### Using App Router

You can create a Route handler that signs people in to Metabase.

Create a new `route.ts` file in your `app/*` directory, for example `app/sso/metabase/route.ts` that corresponds to an endpoint at /sso/metabase. This route handler should generate a JWT for the authenticated user and return the token in a JSON object with the shape `{ jwt: string }`.

```typescript
{% include_file "{{ dirname }}/snippets/next-js/app-router-authentication-api-route.ts" snippet="imports" %}

{% include_file "{{ dirname }}/snippets/next-js/app-router-authentication-api-route.ts" snippet="example" %}
```

Then, pass this `authConfig` to `MetabaseProvider`

```typescript
{% include_file "{{ dirname }}/snippets/next-js/authentication-auth-config.tsx" %}
```

### Using Pages Router

You can create an API route that signs people in to Metabase.

Create a new `metabase.ts` file in your `pages/api/*` directory, for example `pages/api/sso/metabase.ts` that corresponds to an endpoint at /api/sso/metabase. This API route should generate a JWT for the authenticated user and return the token in a JSON object with the shape `{ jwt: string }`.

```typescript
{% include_file "{{ dirname }}/snippets/next-js/pages-router-authentication-api-route.ts" snippet="imports" %}

{% include_file "{{ dirname }}/snippets/next-js/pages-router-authentication-api-route.ts" snippet="example" %}
```

Then, pass this `authConfig` to `MetabaseProvider`

```ts
{% include_file "{{ dirname }}/snippets/next-js/authentication-auth-config.tsx" %}
```
