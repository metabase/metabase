(ns metabase.query-processor.middleware.cache-backend.interface
  "Interface used to define different Query Processor cache backends.
   Defining a backend is straightforward: define a new namespace with the pattern

     metabase.query-processor.middleware.cache-backend.<backend>

   Where backend is a key representing the backend, e.g. `db`, `redis`, or `memcached`.

   In that namespace, create an object that reifies (or otherwise implements) `IQueryProcessorCacheBackend`.
   This object *must* be stored in a var called `instance`.

   That's it. See `metabase.query-processor.middleware.cache-backend.db` for a complete example of how this is done."

   `query-hash` as passed below is a byte-array representing a 256-byte SHA3 hash; encode this as needed for use as a
   cache entry key. RESULTS are passed (and should be returned) as a Clojure object, and individual backends are free
   to encode this as appropriate when storing the results. (It's probably not a bad idea to compress the results; this
   is what the `:db` backend does.)"
