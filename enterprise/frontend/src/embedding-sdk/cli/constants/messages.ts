  This tool will spin up a local Metabase instance via Docker and help you get
  an embedded dashboard in your app.

  - You can't use this tool to connect to an existing Metabase instance.
  - The tool's default setup (which uses API keys) wonâ€™t work in production.
    It's only intended for you to quickly try out the SDK on your local machine.
    A production setup requires a Pro/Enterprise license and SSO with JWT.

  Metabase will phone home some anonymous data collected via Snowplow.
  We donâ€™t collect any usernames, emails, server IPs, database details of any kind, or
  any personally identifiable information (PII).

  This anonymous data helps us understand how people are actually using Metabase, which
  in turn helps us prioritize what to work on next.

  This tool can optionally set up permissions for multi-tenancy in your Metabase.
  It'll create a mock back-end server that signs people into Metabase
  so you can see how different tenants experience the dashboard embedded in your app.

  To set up multi-tenancy and SSO with JWT, you'll need a Pro license.

  If you skip this step, the setup will continue without multi-tenancy or SSO.
