(ns metabase.sync.analyze.classify
  "Analysis sub-step that takes a fingerprint for a Field and infers and saves appropriate information like special
   type. Each 'classifier' takes the information available to it and decides whether or not to run.
   We currently have the following classifiers:

   1.  `name`: Looks at the name of a Field and infers a special type if possible
   2.  `no-preview-display`: Looks at average length of text Field recorded in fingerprint and decides whether or not
        we should hide this Field
   3.  `category`: Looks at the number of distinct values of Field and determines whether it can be a Category
   4.  `text-fingerprint`: Looks at percentages recorded in a text Fields' TextFingerprint and infers a special type
        if possible

   All classifier functions take two arguments, a `FieldInstance` and a possibly `nil` `Fingerprint`, and should
   return the Field with any appropriate changes (such as a new special type). If no changes are appropriate, a
   classifier may return nil. Error handling is handled by `run-classifiers` below, so individual classiers do not
   need to handle errors themselves.

   In the future, we plan to add more classifiers, including ML ones that run offline."
