(defmacro defentity
  "Define a new \"entity\". Entities encapsulate information and behaviors related to a specific table in the Metabase DB,
   and have their own unique record type.

   `defentity` defines a backing record type following the format `<entity>Instance`. For example, the class associated with
   `User` is `metabase.models.user/UserInstance`. This class is used for both the titular korma entity (e.g. `User`) and
   for objects that are fetched from the DB. This means they can share the `IEntity` protocol and simplifies the interface
   somewhat; functions like `types` work on either the entity or instances fetched from the DB.

     (defentity User :metabase_user)  ; creates class `UserInstance` and korma entity `User`

     (metabase.db/sel :one User, ...) ; use with `metabase.db` functions. All results are instances of `UserInstance`
     (korma.core/select User ...)     ; use with korma functions. Results will be regular maps

   The record type automatically extends `IEntity` with `IEntityDefaults`, but you may call `extend` again if you need to
   override default behaviors:

     (extend (class User)             ; it's somewhat more readable to write `(class User)` instead `UserInstance`
       IEntity (merge IEntityDefaults
                      {...}))

   Finally, the entity itself is invokable. Calling with no args returns *all* values of that object; calling with a single
   arg can be used to fetch a specific instance by its integer ID.

     (Database)                       ; return a seq of *all* Databases (as instances of `DatabaseInstance`)
