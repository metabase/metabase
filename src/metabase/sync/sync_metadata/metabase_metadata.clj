(ns metabase.sync.sync-metadata.metabase-metadata
  "Logic for syncing the special `_metabase_metadata` table, which is a way for datasets such as the Sample Database to
  specific properties such as semantic types that should be applied during sync.

  Currently, this is only used by the Sample Database, but theoretically in the future we could add additional sample
  datasets and preconfigure them by populating this Table; or 3rd-party applications or users can add this table to
  their database for an enhanced Metabase experience out-of-the box."

  metadata about the `Tables` and `Fields` it contains. This table is *not* synced normally, i.e. a Metabase `Table`
  is not created for it. Instead, *this* function is called, which reads the data it contains and updates the relevant
  Metabase objects.

  The table should have the following schema:

    column  | type    | example
    --------+---------+-------------------------------------------------
    keypath | varchar | \"products.created_at.description\"
    value   | varchar | \"The date the product was added to our catalog.\"

  of `Table` or `Field`.
