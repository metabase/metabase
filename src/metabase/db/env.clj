  "Logic related to fetching and working with the connection details for the application database. These are provided by
  environment variables -- either as a single JDBC connection URL string (`MB_DB_CONNECTION_URI`) or as broken-out
  enviornment variables e.g. `MB_DB_TYPE`, `MB_DB_HOST`, etc. `MB_DB_CONNECTION_URI` is used preferentially if both
  are specified.

  The `MB_DB_CONNECTION_URI` is unparsed and passed to the jdbc driver with once exception: if it includes credentials
  like `username:password@host:port`. In this case we parse this and log. This functionality will be removed at some
  point so.

  There are two ways we specify JDBC connection information in Metabase code:

  1. As a 'connection details' map that is meant to be UI-friendly; this is the actual map we save when creating a
     `Database` object and the one you can go edit from the admin page. For application DB code, this representation is
     only used in this namespace.

  2. As a `clojure.java.jdbc` connection spec map. This is used internally by lower-level JDBC stuff. We have to
     convert the connections details maps to JDBC specs at some point; Metabase driver code normally handles this.

  There are functions for fetching both types of connection details below.

  Normally you should use the equivalent functions in `metabase.db.connection` which can be overridden rather than
  using this namespace directly."
