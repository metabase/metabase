# What languages can be used with Metabase?

Thanks to our amazing user community, Metabase has been translated into a variety of languages. Due to the nature of how we collect translations (more on that in a minute), available languages may be added or removed during major releases, depending on the translation coverage. 

The available languages as of the 0.33 release are:

* Catalan
* Dutch
* French
* German
* Italian
* Japanese
* Norwegian Bokm√•l
* Polish
* Portuguese
* Spanish
* Russian
* Turkish
* Ukranian
* Vietnamese

Metabase translations are collected via a [POEditor project](https://poeditor.com/join/project/ynjQmwSsGh). In order for a language to be added to Metabase as a supported language, it has to achieve 100% translation. If a language falls below 90% translation, we will remove it from Metabase until it returns to being 100% translated. We make sure to alert the POEditor community a few weeks ahead of a major release if there are languages in danger of being removed from Metabase, and the language coverage can be viewed on the POEditor project page at any time.

Note that while we will only remove languages during major releases, we will add them back in during minor releases - so it's always a good time to jump in and start translating!
