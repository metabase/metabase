# SAML with Keycloak

Keycloak is an open source platform that can be used as a user directory to save user data while acting as the IdP for single sign-on.

1. [Set up SAML in Keycloak](#working-in-the-keycloak-console) (the identity provider).
2. [Set up SAML in Metabase](./authenticating-with-saml.md#enabling-saml-authentication-in-metabase) (the service provider).

For more information, check out our guide for [authenticating with SAML](./authenticating-with-saml.md).

## Working in the Keycloak console

1. Go to the Keycloak admin console and sign in as an administrator.
2. Create a user from **Manage** > **Users**. You'll need to populate the fields with an email, first name, and last name.
3. Once you've created at least one user, navigation tabs will appear at the top of the **Users** page. Go to **Credentials** to set password for your user.
   - Turn off the **Temporary** toggle.
   - Click **Set Password** to save your changes.
4. Create a new SSO client from **Manage** > **Clients** > **Create**

   - **Client ID**: Enter `metabase` in lowercase.
   - **Client type**: Select `SAML` from the dropdown.
   - Click **Next**.
   - **Valid Redirect URIs**: The URL where you are hosting your Metabase instance followed by a slash (/) and an asterisk (_). For example, if you are hosting Metabase locally at `http://localhost:3000`, the URL would be `http://localhost:3000/_`.
   - **Home URL**: In your Metabase, go to **Admin settings** > **Authentication** > **SAML**. You'll find your Home URL in the field **URL the IdP should redirect back to**.
   - Click **Save**.

5. (Optional) Disable key signing for SSO client. See [settings for signing SSO requests](https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/people-and-groups/authenticating-with-saml#settings-for-signing-sso-requests-optional).

   - Click **Keys** tab.
   - **Client signature required:** Off.

6. Map user attributes from Metabase to SSO client.
   - Click **Client scopes** tab.
   - Click `metabase-dedicated`.
   - Click **Add predefined mappers**.
   - [Map attributes from users in Keycloak to Metabase](#mapping-attributes-from-users-in-keycloak-to-metabase).
7. Configure the service provider (Metabase) from **Configure** > **Realm Settings**.
   - From **Endpoints**, select “SAML 2.0 Identity Provider Metadata”.
   - An XML file will open in a new tab.
   - Keep this for reference, we will use it in the next section to configure Metabase.

## Mapping fields from Keycloak to Metabase

1. Go to your Metabase **Admin settings** > **Authentication** > **SAML**.
2. From the XML file from Step 7 above:
   - **SAML Identity Provider URL**: Insert the URL that appears right after the following string: `Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST" Location=`
   - **SAML Identity Provider Issuer**: Insert the URL that appears right after `entityID=`.
   - **SAML Identity Provider Certificate**: Input the long string that appears after the `<X509Certificate>` tag. Take care when inserting this string: if any letters or special characters are added or off, the setup won't work.
   - **SAML Application Name**: `metabase`
3. Click **Save Changes**.
4. Check that **SAML Authentication** is toggled **ON** at the top of the page.

## Mapping attributes from users in Keycloak to Metabase

Keycloak can import four user attributes by default: name, surname, email and role.

Let's say we want email, name, and surname to be passed between the client (Metabase) and the authentication server (Keycloak).

1. Select “X500 email”, “X500 givenName” and “X500 surname” from the checkboxes that are on the right side of the console.
2. Click **Add Selected**.
3. Click **Edit** beside each attribute and make the following changes:
   - **SAML Attribute Name**: the name that Metabase expects to receive.
   - **SAML Attribute NameFormat**: select “Basic” from the dropdown menu.

You can edit the attribute values from your Metabase **Admin settings** > **Authentication** > **SAML** > **Attributes**.
