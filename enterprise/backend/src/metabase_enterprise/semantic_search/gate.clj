(ns metabase-enterprise.semantic-search.gate
  "The gate table (managed by index-metadata) decouples document ingestion from embedding computation and indexing.

  By avoiding producer/consumer coupling in this instance we get some advantages:
  - downstream consumers can take an unbounded amount of time without necessarily increasing memory usage or providing
    blocking backpressure onto search ingestion
  - downstream consumers can recover after transient indexing/embedding errors, or due to process loss during indexing.
  - multiple downstream indexes (or intermediate structures) can be maintained on a single document source
    without re-reading the data from the appdb.
  - provides opportunities to avoid wasted work when reindexing
    (which is ultimately still necessary as the search ingestion system itself can lose data).

  This namespace provides the `gate-documents!` function for writing gate documents and enforcing ordering guarantees.
  Additionally, polling support functions are defined for indexing (see the lib indexer).

  IMPORTANT: The gating mechanism is still based on heuristics, it alone is not enough to guarantee index convergence.
  It only allows you to converge on a consistent index more often than if it did not exist (i.e. Re-indexes can be less frequent, and less expensive).

  NOTE: The 'immediate mode' indexing apis in the libs: (index, pgvector-api) are still available and work as document
  but are not coordinated with any gated updates and therefore might race if gate indexers are also running."
