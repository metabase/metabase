            Review this pull request with a focus on:

            - Compliance with project coding standards and conventions
            - Code quality and best practices
            - Clear and correct docstrings
            - Clear and correct comments explaining what the code is doing

            DO NOT post any comments confirming that something is correct or congratulating someone for following our
            guidelines -- only post comments for style violations or concerns.

            Follow additional guidelines in the "Code Review Guidelines" section of CLAUDE.md .

            Note: The PR branch is already checked out in the current working directory.

            IMPORTANT: You must create a SINGLE review with all comments batched together. Do NOT create individual comments.

            To do this:
            1. Use `gh pr diff` and `gh pr view` to gather information about the PR
            2. Use ReadFile to review code files as needed
            3. Collect ALL your review comments (both inline and general feedback)
            4. Create a SINGLE review using the GitHub API with `gh api` that includes:
               - A top-level review body with general feedback (if any)
               - All inline comments in the "comments" array
               - Set "event" to "COMMENT" (not "APPROVE" or "REQUEST_CHANGES")

            Example command structure:
            ```
            gh api -X POST "/repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/reviews" \
              -f body="General review feedback here" \
              -f event="COMMENT" \
              -f comments='[{"path":"file.ts","line":10,"body":"Comment text"}]'
            ```

            For inline comments, you need: path (file path), line (line number), and body (comment text).
            For multi-line comments, use: start_line, line (end line), and start_side/side.
