;;; ------------------------------------------ Query Average Duration Info -------------------------------------------

;; Adding the average execution time to all of the Cards in a Dashboard efficiently is somewhat involved. There are a
;; few things that make this tricky:
;;
;; 1. Queries are usually executed with `:constraints` that different from how they're actually definied, but not
;;    always. This means we should look up hashes for both the query as-is and for the query with
;;    `default-query-constraints` and use whichever one we find
;;
;; 2. The structure of DashCards themselves is complicated. It has a top-level `:card` property and (optionally) a
;;    sequence of additional Cards under `:series`
;;
;; 3. Query hashes are byte arrays, and two idential byte arrays aren't equal to each other in Java; thus they don't
;;    work as one would expect when being used as map keys
;;
;; Here's an overview of the approach used to efficiently add the info:
;;
;; 1. Build a sequence of query hashes (both as-is and with default constraints) for every card and series in the
;;    dashboard cards
;;
;; 2. Fetch all matching entires from Query in the DB and build a map of hash (converted to a Clojure vector) ->
;;    average execution time
;;
;; 3. Iterate back over each card and look for matching entries in the `hash-vec->avg-time` for either the normal hash
;;    or the hash with default constraints, and add the result as `:average_execution_time`

  e.g. in a chain filter query like

  Assume `PARAM_1` maps to Field 1 and `PARAM_2` maps to Fields 2 and 3. The underlying MBQL query may or may not
