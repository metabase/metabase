Since Metabase is a self-hosted tool, things like email notifications are configured by someone within your organization — if you reach out to them, they should be able to check the configuration settings and make sure everything is set up correctly. It may help to point them to [this guide](../../administration-guide/02-setting-up-email.md) on enabling email functionality.
