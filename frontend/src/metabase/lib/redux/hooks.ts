// Note (EmmadUsmani): This interface is simply to keep typescript from erroring when
// typing `useDispatch`. Insipiration was taken from `redux-thunk`'s `ThunkDispatch` type
// (https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk/blob/e3d452948d5562b9ce871cc9391403219f83b4ff/src/types.ts#L14).
// It is intentionally vague, we have middlewares that support more action types that are not covered here
