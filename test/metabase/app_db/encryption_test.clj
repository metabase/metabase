  ;; Re-enacts how a boot of a pre-encryption build undoes the one-shot encryption backfills: its seeding reads the
  ;; encrypted `notification_recipient.details` through plain `transform-json`, gets a ciphertext string instead of a
  ;; map, decides the row changed, and re-creates it through its plaintext-era transforms. Isolated app DB: runs with
  ;; an encryption key active, so nothing here may touch the shared test DB.
