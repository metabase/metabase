  "Returns a map wrapped in a deref-able auto-closable, to be used in a with-open.

  The map contains:
  - :s3-client   - an S3Client that can be used to upload/download files
  - :bucket-name - the S3 bucket name
  - :objects     - a map of keys to {:path :method :url} maps, where:
    - :path   is the S3 key
    - :method is either :get or :put, indicating whether the python-runner should fetch or upload the file.
    - :url    is the presigned URL to be used by the python-runner to fetch or upload the file.

  The objects are broken into the following transform inputs:

  - [:table id :manifest] - for each input table, the manifest JSON file
  - [:table id :data]     - for each input table, the data file, in format specified by the manifest.

  And the following transform outputs:
  - :output-manifest - the output manifest JSON file
  - :output          - the output data file, in format specified by the output manifest.
  - :events          - a JSONL file containing the events logged during python execution.
