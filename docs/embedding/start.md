# Embedding overview

## [Introduction](./introduction.md)

What is embedding, and how does it work?

## [Signed embedding](./signed-embedding.md)

Also known as Standalone Embedding, Signed Embedding offers partial drill-through with custom destinations, so you can define what happens when people click on a chart, like sending people to another chart or URLâ€“all while securing the underlying data.

## [Full-app embedding](./full-app-embedding.md)

Put all of Metabase in your app to give people secure self-serve access to data. Full-app Embedding offers full drill-through: you can set custom destinations if you want, or let people slice and dice their data using Metabase's query builder.
