(ns metabase.sync.analyze.classifiers.category
  "Classifier that determines whether a Field should be marked as a `:type/Category` and/or as a `list` Field based on
  the number of distinct values it has.

  As of Metabase v0.29, the Category now longer has any use inside of the Metabase backend; it is used
  only for frontend purposes (e.g. deciding which widget to show). Previously, makring something as a Category meant
  that its values should be cached and saved in a FieldValues object. With the changes in v0.29, this is instead
  managed by a column called `has_field_values`.

  A value of `list` now means the values should be cached. Deciding whether a Field should be a `list` Field is still
  determined by the cardinality of the Field, like Category status. Thus it is entirely possibly for a Field to be
  both a Category and a `list` Field."
