# Field types


While data types indicate to a database how it should interpret the values in a field, __field types__ or __semantic types__ describe the _meaning_ of a field. For example, a column's data type could be ```type/text``` but the semantic type may be __Email__. Field types are just one example of metadata—information about data—that [Admins can change](./metadata-editing.md) in Metabase.

Field types dictate how Metabase displays its data, as well as the column’s special functionality, if any. By marking columns in a table as __Latitude__ and __Longitude__, Metabase can use the columns to create pin and heat maps. Similarly, designating a column as a __URL__ allows users to click on the link to visit that URL.

## List of Metabase Field Types

Metabase recognizes the following field types:

- **Overall Row**
  - **Entity Key** – The field in this table that uniquely identifies each row. Could be a product ID, serial number, etc.
  - **Entity Name** – Different from the entity key, the entity name represents what each row in the table *is*. For example, in a Users table, the User column might be the entity name.
  - **Foreign Key** – The column in this table that (usually) refers to the primary key of another table in order to connect data from different tables that are related. For example, in a Products table, you might have a Customer ID field that points to a Customers table, where Customer ID is the primary key.

- **Categorical**
  - **Enum** - An abbreviation for “enumerated type,” the value of an enum draws on a predefined list of options. An example of an enum would be a field for the months of the year. This list of twelve options is defined in makeup of the column, and no options outside this list would be valid.
  - Product

## Using field types in Metabase

### Fields types in models

You can set field types for models, which helps Metabase understand how to work with data in models built using SQL. You can also configure text fields in models to [surface individual records in search](./models.md#surface-individual-records-in-search-by-matching-against-this-column).

### X-rays

When you [X-ray](../exploration-and-organization/x-rays.md) a table, Metabase considers both the data type and the field type to display different charts that summarize that data.

### Field Filters

Knowing what field types are and how they work is helpful when using [field filters](https://www.metabase.com/learn/sql-questions/field-filters.html), as you can only create field filters for [certain field types](../questions/native-editor/sql-parameters.md#field-filter-compatible-types).

### Editing types in the Table Metadata page

If you're an administrator, you can edit field types using the [Table Metadata page](./metadata-editing.md) in the Admin Panel.

While data types themselves can't be edited in Metabase, admins can manually [cast data types](./metadata-editing.md#casting-to-a-specific-data-type) to be read differently, like interpreting a numerical data type as a date format.
