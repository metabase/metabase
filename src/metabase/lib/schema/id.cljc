  "The ID used to signify that a database is 'virtual' rather than physical.

   A fake integer ID is used so as to minimize the number of changes that need to be made on the frontend -- by using
   something that would otherwise be a legal ID, *nothing* need change there, and the frontend can query against this
   'database' none the wiser. (This integer ID is negative which means it will never conflict with a *real* database
   ID.)

   This ID acts as a sort of flag. The relevant places in the middleware can check whether the DB we're querying is
   this 'virtual' database and take the appropriate actions."

;;; EDIT: Sometimes the FE uses this when starting a query based on a Card if it doesn't know the database associated
;;; with that Card. The QP will resolve this to the correct Database later.
