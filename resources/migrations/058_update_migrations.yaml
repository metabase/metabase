# >>>>>>>>>> DO NOT ADD NEW MIGRATIONS BELOW THIS LINE! ADD THEM ABOVE <<<<<<<<<<

########################################################################################################################
#
# ADVICE:
#
# 1) Think through some of these points when writing a migration, learn from our past mistakes:
#    - Do you really need a migration? Could the feature work without it? Prefer not to if possible.
#      Data in the wild can be vastly different from what you expect, and it's hard to get right.
#    - Make sure your migration is backward compatible: it might not be possible to add a constraint back
#      if you drop it in a migration.
#    - Postgres, MySQL and H2 have their differences. Make sure your migration works for all.
#    - Database encryption is a major issue:
#      - Fields like `metabase_database.details` or `setting.value` can be encrypted, so you need to decrypt them in
#        your migration. See #42617, #44048.
#      - Database could be partially encrypted, see https://www.notion.so/72575933ef2a446bafd16909e05a7387
#    - Custom migrations:
#      - Prefer SQL migrations when possible.
#      - Never use application code: it can change and *will* break your migration.
#      - Do not use Toucan models - refer table names directly.
#      - If it's a big change, consider using Quartz, see #42279
#      - More in `metabase.app_db.custom_migrations` namespace doc.
#    - Never delete a migration: users won't be able to downgrade. If you really need to, see #44908
#    - Migration id (`vXX.<date>`) must match its earliest released version:
#      - Do not backport `v51....` to version 50, Metabase will try to downgrade it.
#      - Instead, write a migration with an oldest target you plan to backport to in mind.
#
# 2) Migrations should go in the ###_update_migrations.yaml file for the target version.
#
# 3) Run mage lint-migrations to run core.spec checks against any changes you make here. Liquibase is pretty
#    forgiving and won't complain if you accidentally mix up things like deleteCascade and onDelete: CASCADE. CI runs
#    this check but it's nicer to know now instead of waiting for CI.
#
# 3) Migration IDs should follow the format
#
#    vMM.TIMESTAMP
#
#    Where
#
#    M         = major version
#    TIMESTAMP = the current timestamp with format `yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss`
#                To get this timestamp, evaluate this in your REPL: `(dev/migration-timestamp)`
#
#    E.g: You're adding a new migration for version 49, And it's 10:30:00AM on April 1, 2023 (UTC),
#    your migration id should be: `v49.2023-04-01T10:30:00`.
#
# PLEASE KEEP THIS MESSAGE AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS FILE!!!!! Add new migrations above the message.
