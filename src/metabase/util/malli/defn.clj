  "Implementation of [[metabase.util.malli/defn]]. Like [[schema.core/defn]], but for Malli.

  Doesn't Malli already have a version of this in [[malli.experimental]]? It does, but it tends to eat memory; see
  https://metaboat.slack.com/archives/CKZEMT1MJ/p1690496060299339 and #32843 for more information. This new
  implementation solves most of our memory consumption problems.

  Example macroexpansion:

    (mu/defn f :- :int
      [x :- :int]
      (inc x))

    ;; =>

    (def f
      (let [&f (fn [x] (inc x))]
        (fn ([a]
             (metabase.util.malli.fn/validate-input :int a)
             (->> (&f a)
                  (metabase.util.malli.fn/validate-output :int))))))

  Known issue: does not currently generate automatic type hints the way [[schema.core/defn]] does, nor does it attempt
  to preserve them if you specify them manually. We can fix this in the future."
