;; # How does search scoring work?
;;
;; _This was written for a success engineer, but may be helpful here, too._
;;
;; Most of what you care about happens in the `scoring.clj` file [here](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/blob/master/src/metabase/search/scoring.clj).
;;
;; We have two sets of scorers. The first is based on the literal text matches and defined [here](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/blob/8d5f5db02c84899a053e20468986050b2034a9a4/src/metabase/search/scoring.clj#L132C1-L137):
;;
;; <pre><code>
;; (def ^:private match-based-scorers
;;   [{:scorer exact-match-scorer :name "exact-match" :weight 4}
;;    {:scorer consecutivity-scorer :name "consecutivity" :weight 2}
;;    {:scorer total-occurrences-scorer :name "total-occurrences" :weight 2}
;;    {:scorer fullness-scorer :name "fullness" :weight 1}
;;    {:scorer prefix-scorer :name "prefix" :weight 1}])
;; </code></pre>
;;
;; * The `exact-match-scorer` gives points for exact matches. So if you search `foo` it'll score well for `foo
;;   collection` but not `my favorite foods`. Everything else counts partial matches
;;
;; * `consecutivity-scorer` gives points for a sequence of matching words. So if you search `four five six seven`
;;   it'll score well for `one two three four five six seven eight` and 0 for `eight seven six five four three two
;;   one`.
;;
;; * `total-occurrences-scorer` gives points for the number of tokens that show up in the search result. So if you
;;   search for `foo bar` it'll score better for `Admiral Akbar's Food Truck` (2; note that `akbar` and `food` count
;;   as matches even though it's not exact) than for `foo collection` (1; being an exact match doesn't matter. That's
;;   why we have the `exact-match-scorer`).
;;
;; * `fullness-scorer` is sort of the opposite of that: it gives points for how much of the result is "covered" by the
;;   search query. So if you search `foo bar` then `Barry's Food` will have a perfect fullness score and `Barry's
;;   Dashboard Of Favorite Bars, Restaurants, and Food Trucks` will score poorly since only 3/9 of the dashboard's
;;   title is covered by the search query. Why 3? `bar` matches both `Barry's` and `Bars`.
;;
;; * `prefix-scorer` gives points for an exact prefix match. So if you search for `foo bar` then `foo collection` will
;;   have a good prefix score (4/24: `foo ` matches), `Food trucks I love` will have a worse one (3/18), and
;;   `top 10 foo bars` will be zero.
;;
;;
;; These are all weighted: you can see that the exact-match scorer is responsible for 4/10 of the score, the consecutivity one is 2/10, etc.
;;
;; The second set of scorers is defined lower down,
;; [here](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/blob/8d5f5db02c84899a053e20468986050b2034a9a4/src/metabase/search/scoring.clj#L215-L222):
;;
;; <pre><code>
;; (defn weights-and-scores
;;   "Default weights and scores for a given result."
;;   [result]
;;   [{:weight 2 :score (pinned-score result) :name "pinned"}
;;    {:weight 2 :score (bookmarked-score result) :name "bookmarked"}
;;    {:weight 3/2 :score (recency-score result) :name "recency"}
;;    {:weight 1 :score (dashboard-count-score result) :name "dashboard"}
;;    {:weight 1/2 :score (model-score result) :name "model"}])
;; </code></pre>
;;
;; And there are two more for Enterprise
;; [here](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/blob/8d5f5db02c84899a053e20468986050b2034a9a4/enterprise/backend/src/metabase_enterprise/search/scoring.clj#L27-L33):
;;
;; <pre><code>
;; (premium-features/has-feature? :official-collections)
;;     (conj {:weight 2
;;             :score  (official-collection-score result)
;;             :name   "official collection score"})
;;     (premium-features/has-feature? :content-verification)
;;     (conj {:weight 2
;;            :score  (verified-score result)
;;            :name   "verified"})))
;; </code></pre>
;;
;; These are easier to explain: you get points if the search result is pinned (yes or no), bookmarked (yes or no), how
;; recently it was updated (sliding value between 1 (edited just now) and 0 (edited [180+
;; days](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/blob/8d5f5db02c84899a053e20468986050b2034a9a4/src/metabase/search/config.clj#L29-L32)
;; ago), how many dashboards it appears in (sliding value between 0 (zero dashboards) and 1 ([50+
;; dashboards](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/blob/8d5f5db02c84899a053e20468986050b2034a9a4/src/metabase/search/config.clj#L34-L36))
;; and it's type (`model-score`): the earlier a type appears in [this
;; list](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/blob/8d5f5db02c84899a053e20468986050b2034a9a4/src/metabase/search/config.clj#L55-L58)
;; the higher score it gets:
;;
;; <code> ["dashboard" "metric" "segment" "indexed-entity" "card" "dataset" "collection" "table" "action" "database"]</code>
;;
;; On the EE side, we also give points if something's an official collection and if it's verified.
;;
;; Finally, what we actually search is defined in the search
;; config [here](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/blob/8d5f5db02c84899a053e20468986050b2034a9a4/src/metabase/search/config.clj#L73-L109),
;; but the short answer is "the name and, if there is one, the description". We used to search raw SQL queries for
;; cards, but that got turned off recently (but I've seen chat about turning it back on).
;;
;; ❦
;;
;; So, these 12 scorers are weighted and combined together, and the grand total affects search order. If this sounds a
;; little complicated…it is! It also means that it can be tricky to give a proper answer about why the search ranking
;; is "wrong", maybe you search for `monthly revenue` and are looking for a card called `monthly revenue` and are mad
;; that a dashboard called `company stats` shows up first…but then it turns out that the dashboard's description is
;; `Stats that everyone should be aware of, such as our order count and monthly revenue.` and the dashboard happens to
;; be pinned, bookmarked, part of an official collection, verified, and edited a couple hours ago…whereas the card is
;; none of those things.
;;
;; Also, be aware that as of October 2023 there's [a big epic under
;; way](https://github.com/metabase/metabase/issues/27982) to add filtering to search results, which should help
;; people find what they're looking for (and spares us from having to make the above algorithm better).
