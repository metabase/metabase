# Questions

Questions are queries plus their visualization. You can ask questions using Metabase's graphical query builder, or create a native/SQL query.

## Query builder

### [Asking questions](./query-builder/introduction.md)

An introduction to Metabase's graphical query builder.

### [Custom expressions](./query-builder/expressions.md)

Custom expressions, like spreadsheet formulas, are tools you can use in the graphical query builder to ask more complicated questions.

### [List of expressions](./query-builder/expressions.md)

A list of the aggregations and functions available in the graphical query builder.

### [Joining data](./query-builder/join.md)

You can join data to combine your current data with another table, or even with a saved question.

## Native query editor

Also known as the SQL editor (we say native because you can also query data sources that don't use SQL, like MongoDB and Google Analytics).

### [Introduction to the native query editor](./sql-and-native-queries/writing-sql.md)

Write native code to query your data source.

### [Viewing metadata](./sql-and-native-queries/data-model-reference.md)

Metabase's data model reference can help you understand your tables and fields.

### [SQL templates](./sql-and-native-queries/sql-parameters.md)

Use variables to make native queries interactive.

### [SQL snippets](./sql-and-native-queries/sql-snippets.md)

Reuse and share bits of SQL.
