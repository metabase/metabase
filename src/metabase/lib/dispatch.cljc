(defn dispatch-value
  "Dispatch value for a clause, map, or other object. Dispatch rules are as follows:

  1. If it is an MBQL clause (vector with a keyword as its first argument), dispatch on that clause keyword

  2. If it is a map with a `:lib/type` key, dispatch on that;

  3. Otherwise, dispatch on a keyword representing the class of the object, e.g. `:dispatch-type/string` for a String.
     The main reason this returns weird keywords like this rather than class names like `String` is to make it easier to
     write cross-compatible code. See [[u/dispatch-type-keyword]] for more info."
