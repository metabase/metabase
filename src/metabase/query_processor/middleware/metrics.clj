(defn- adjust-metric-stages
  "`expanded-stages` are the result of :stages from fetch-source-query.
   All source-card stages have been spliced in already.

   `metric-ref-lookup` this is a volatile that holds references to the original aggragation clause (count, sum etc...)
   it is used to replace `[:metric {} id]` clauses. This depends on the order of `walk` as each join is touched depth-first,
   a ref-lookup will be added for any metrics found during the stage.

   To adjust:

   We look for the transition between the last stage of a metric and the next stage following it.
   We adjust those two stages - as explained in `expand`.

  "Adjusts the final and following stages of `:source-card` of `:type` `:metric`.

   Expects stages to have been processed by `fetch-source-query/resolve-source-cards`
   such that source card stages have been spliced in across the query.

   The final stage of metric is adjusted by:
   ```
   :aggregation - always removed
   :breakout    - removed if there are following-stages
   :order-by    - removed if there are following-stages
   :limit       - removed if there are following-stages
