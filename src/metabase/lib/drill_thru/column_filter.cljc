  "Enables \"Filter by this column\" menu item.

  The caveat here is that for aggregation and breakout columns we need to append a stage before adding a filter. There
  is a helper function called `filterDrillDetails` which returns the query with a possibly appended stage, and the
  corresponding column for that stage. In each test case where drill thru is allowed we need to verify that
  `filterDrillDetails` appended the stage where needed.

  Another caveat is that we need to verify that `filterDrillDetails` returned a _filterable_ column, i.e. a column
  obtained from `filterableColumns` call. A good way to verify that is to call `filterableColumnOperators` and check
  that a non-empty list is returned.

  Entry points:

  - Column header

  Requirements:

  - Column not `type/Structured`

  Query transformation:

  - None/identity. The FE will show the FilterPicker and not call `drillThru` for this drill.

  Question transformation:
  - None"
