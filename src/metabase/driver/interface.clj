;; ## ISyncDriverField Protocols

;; Sync drivers need to implement either ISyncDriverFieldValues or ISyncDriverFieldAvgLength *and* ISyncDriverFieldPercentUrls.
;;
;; ISyncDriverFieldValues is used to provide a generic fallback implementation of the other two that calculate these values by
;; iterating over *every* value of the Field in Clojure-land. Since that's slower, it's preferable to provide implementations
;; of ISyncDriverFieldAvgLength/ISyncDriverFieldPercentUrls when possible. (You can also implement ISyncDriverFieldValues and
;; *one* of the other two; the optimized implementation will be used for that and the fallback implementation for the other)

(defprotocol ISyncDriverFieldValues
  "Optional. Used to implement generic fallback implementations of `ISyncDriverFieldAvgLength` and `ISyncDriverFieldPercentUrls`.
   If a sync driver doesn't implement *either* of those protocols, it must implement this one."
  (field-values-lazy-seq [this field]
    "Return a lazy sequence of all values of Field."))

(defprotocol ISyncDriverFieldAvgLength
  "Optional. If this isn't provided, a fallback implementation that calculates average length in Clojure-land will be used instead.
   If a driver doesn't implement this protocol, it *must* implement `ISyncDriverFieldValues`."
  (field-avg-length [this field]
    "Return the average length of all non-nil values of textual FIELD."))

(defprotocol ISyncDriverFieldPercentUrls
  "Optional. If this isn't provided, a fallback implementation that calculates URL percentage in Clojure-land will be used instead.
   If a driver doesn't implement this protocol, it *must* implement `ISyncDriverFieldValues`."
  (field-percent-urls [this field]
    "Return the percentage of non-nil values of textual FIELD that are valid URLs."))
