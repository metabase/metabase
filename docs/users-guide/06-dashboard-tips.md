##Tips on Creating Helpful Dashboards
To make a dashboard that is actually helpful, decide what you want the dashboard to tell you about your data.  What questions will give you insight into what you want to know?  

Once you know what questions you want to know the answer to, make a question card for each question and save them.  Then save the cards to the dashboard.  Once you have the cards you want, structure the cards so that users can easily consume the information.  Place the most important cards near the top of the dashboard or make them bigger than the other cards.  Doing so, will naturally draw users' attention to the cards.

If you have more than 10 cards on a dashboard, consider breaking the dashboard into two separate ones.  You don't want to overwhelm users with too much information and each dashboard should revolve around one theme.  Remember you can make as many dashboards as you want - there's no limit!
