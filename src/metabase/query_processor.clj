;; Each query processor function is passed a single arg, QP, and returns a function that accepts a single arg, QUERY.

;; This returned function *pre-processes* QUERY as needed, and then passes it to QP.
;; The function may then *post-process* the results of (QP QUERY) as neeeded, and returns the results.
;;
;; Many functions do both pre and post-processing; this middleware pattern allows them to return closures that maintain some sort of
;; internal state. For example, `cumulative-sum` can determine if it needs to perform cumulative summing, and, if so, modify the query
;; before passing it to QP; once the query is processed, it can use modify the results as needed.
;;
;; PRE-PROCESSING fns are applied from bottom to top, and POST-PROCESSING from top to bottom;
;; the easiest way to wrap your head around this is picturing a the query as a ball being thrown in the air
