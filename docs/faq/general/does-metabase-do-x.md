# Does Metabase do X?

If you’re not sure if Metabase has the capability you’re looking for, we would recommend asking in [Discourse](https://discourse.metabase.com/). If it’s something we don’t do, our friendly community may be able to point you towards a workaround, or the Github issue where the feature has been requested.
