;; Occasionally we want to update the schema of our Field fingerprints and add new logic to populate the additional
;; keys. However, by default, analysis (which includes fingerprinting) only runs on *NEW* Fields, meaning *EXISTING*
;; Fields won't get new fingerprints with the updated info.
;;
;; To work around this, we can use a versioning system. Fields whose Fingerprint's version is lower than the current
;; version should get updated during the next sync/analysis regardless of whether they are or are not new Fields.
;; However, this could be quite inefficient: if we add a new fingerprint field for `:type/Number` Fields, why should
;; we re-fingerprint `:type/Text` Fields? Ideally, we'd only re-fingerprint the numeric Fields.
;;
;; Thus, our implementation below. Each new fingerprint version lists a set of types that should be upgraded to it.
;; Our fingerprinting logic will calculate whether a fingerprint needs to be recalculated based on its version and the
;; changes that have been made in subsequent versions. Only the Fields that would benefit from the new Fingerprint
;; info need be re-fingerprinted.
;;
;; Thus, if Fingerprint v2 contains some new info for numeric Fields, only Fields that derive from `:type/Number` need
;; be upgraded to v2. Textual Fields with a v1 fingerprint can stay at v1 for the time being. Later, if we introduce a
;; v3 that includes new "global" fingerprint info, both the v2-fingerprinted numeric Fields and the v1-fingerprinted
;; textual Fields can be upgraded to v3.
