;;; ------------------------------------------------- Normalization --------------------------------------------------

;; The following functions make it easier to deal with MBQL queries, which are case-insensitive, string/keyword
;; insensitive, and underscore/hyphen insensitive.  These should be preferred instead of assuming the frontend will
;; always pass in clauses the same way, since different variation are all legal under MBQL '98.

;; TODO - In the future it might make sense to simply walk the entire query and normalize the whole thing when it
;; comes in. I've tried implementing middleware to do that but it ended up breaking a few things that wrongly assume
;; different clauses will always use a certain case (e.g. SQL `:template_tags`). Fixing all of that is out-of-scope
;; for the nested queries PR but should possibly be revisited in the future.
