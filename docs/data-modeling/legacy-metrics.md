# Legacy metrics

Metabase upgraded [metrics](./metrics.md) starting in version 51.

If you're upgrading from Metabase 50 or earlier, all of your existing metrics will be migrated to the new metrics, which you can find in the Migrated Metrics V1 collection with curate access only for admins. You can leave the metrics there, or move them into different collections.

## What's new with metrics

- Anyone can create a new metric.
- Metrics can be stored (and pinned) to collections.
- If you have curate access to the collection, you can edit a metric in that collection.
- You can explore metrics in your Metabase in the data browser.
