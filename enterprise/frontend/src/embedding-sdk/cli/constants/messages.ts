  Metabase will phone home some data collected via Snowplow.
  We donâ€™t collect any usernames, emails, server IPs, database details of any kind, or
  any personally identifiable information (PII).

  This anonymous data helps us understand how people are actually using Metabase, which
  in turn helps us prioritize what to work on next.
