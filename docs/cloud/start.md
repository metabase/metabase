# Metabase Cloud

Metabase Cloud is what we call our hosted service for our [Starter](/product/starter), [Pro](/product/pro), and [Enterprise](/product/enterprise) plans. We deal with running your Metabase server for you, manage uptime and backups, and handle all the upgrades so you're always on the latest version of Metabase.

## Metabase Cloud documentation

Manage your Metabase Cloud instance, subscription, and billing via the [Metabase Store](https://store.metabase.com/account).
