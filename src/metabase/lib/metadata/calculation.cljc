 * `returned-columns` for a join is the same as `returned-columns` for the last stage of the join -- the columns have
   source and desired aliases appropriate for the join's `:stages` if they were an entirely independent query, and do
   not include join aliases!

 * `returned-columns` for a stage have source and desired aliases relative to that stage!

 * `returned-columns` for a Card has the same source and desired aliases you'd see in that Card's `:result-metadata`!!"
