  "For each of `needles` (which must be a ref) find the column or ref in `haystack` that it most closely matches. This
  is meant to power things like [[metabase.lib.breakout/breakoutable-columns]] which are supposed to include
  `:breakout-position` for columns that are already present as a breakout; sometimes the column in the breakout does not
  exactly match what MLv2 would have generated. So try to figure out which column it is referring to. The fuzzy matching
  is powered by the \"squinting\" logic defined in this namespace.

  As a special case, if the input ref has an ID, and 1 or more `haystacks` have the same ID, those are immediately
  matched.

  The `haystack` can be either `MetadataColumns` or refs.

  Returns a map with `haystack` values as keys (whether they be columns or refs) and the corresponding index in
  `needles` as values. If for some `needle` there is no match, that index will not appear in the map.

  If there are multiple matches for a `needle` at the same level of \"squinting\", an error is thrown.
  TODO: Perhaps there are legitimate cases where this will happen? If so, we should add logic to disambiguate matches.
  (For example, prefer any other `:source/*` over `:source/implicitly-joinable`, if the `needle` has no `:join-alias`.)

  `opts` can be used to influence the level of flexibility.
    :keep-join? if truthy, the join information will not be ignored

  If you want to check that a single ref exists in a set of columns, call [[find-closest-matching-ref]] instead.

  The four- and five-arity versions can also find matches between integer Field ID references like `[:field {} 1]` and
  equivalent string column name field literal references like `[:field {} \"bird_type\"]` by resolving Field IDs using
  the `query` and `stage-number`. This is ultimately a hacky workaround for totally busted legacy queries.

  Note that this currently only works when `needles` contain integer Field IDs. Any refs in the `haystack` must have
  string literal column names. Luckily we currently don't have problems with MLv1/legacy queries accidentally using
  string `:field` literals where it shouldn't have been doing so.

  Returns a list parallel to `needles`, where each element is either nil (no match) or the index of the most closely
  matching ref in `haystack`.

  IMPORTANT!

  When trying to find the matching ref for a sequence of metadatas, prefer [[closest-matching-metadata]] instead, which
  is less broken (see [[metabase.lib.equality-test/closest-matching-metadata-test]]) and slightly more performant, since
