# Troubleshooting connection timeouts

If your queries are hanging or timing out, the problem could be coming from your:

- Load balancer
- Reverse proxy server (e.g., Nginx)
- Jetty
- Database
- Cloud service (such as AWSâ€™s Elastic Beanstalk, EC2, Heroku, or Google App Engine).

Fixing this depends on your specific deployment setup. These resources may help:
