# Adding and managing databases

Connect Metabase to your data sources.

## Adding a database connection

To add a database connection, click on the **gear** icon in the top right, and navigate to **Admin settings** > **Databases** > **Add a database**.

Fill out the fields for that database, and click **Save changes** at the bottom.

The connection settings differ database to database. For the list of connection settings available for your database, click on the link to your database below.

## Connecting to supported databases

If you don't see your database listed here, see [partner and community drivers](../developers-guide/partner-and-community-drivers.md#partner-drivers).

## Connecting to databases hosted by a cloud provider

For provider-specific connection details, like connecting to a PostgreSQL data warehouse on RDS:

- [AWS's Relational Database Service (RDS)](./connections/aws-rds.md)

## Syncing and scanning databases

Metabase runs syncs and scans to stay up to date with your database.

- **Syncs** get updated schemas to display in the [Data Browser](https://www.metabase.com/learn/getting-started/data-browser).
- **Scans** take samples of column values to populate filter dropdown menus and suggest helpful visualizations. Metabase does not store _complete_ tables from your database.

When Metabase first connects to your database, it performs a **scan** to determine the metadata of the columns in your tables and automatically assign each column a [semantic type](../data-modeling/field-types.md).

During the scan, Metabase also takes a sample of each table to look for URLs, JSON, encoded strings, etc. You can map table and column metadata to new values from **Admin settings** > **Data model**. Check out [editing metadata](../data-modeling/metadata-editing.md).

### Choose when Metabase syncs and scans

Turn this option **ON** to manage the queries that Metabase uses to stay up to date with your database. 

#### Scheduling database syncs

If you've selected **Choose when syncs and scans happen** > **ON**, you'll see the following options under **Database syncing**:

- **Scan** sets the frequency of the [sync query](#how-database-syncs-work) to hourly (default) or daily.
- **at** sets the time when your sync query will run against your database (in the timezone of the server where your Metabase app is running).

#### Scheduling database scans

If you've selected **Choose when syncs and scans happen** > **ON**, you'll see the following options under **Scanning for filter values**:

![Scanning options](./images/scanning-options.png)

- **Regularly, on a schedule** allows you to run [scan queries](#how-database-scans-work) at a frequency that matches the rate of change to your database. The time is set in the timezone of the server where your Metabase app is running. This is the best option for a small database, or tables with distinct values that get updated often.
- **Only when adding a new filter widget** is a great option if you want scan queries to run on demand. Turning this option **ON** means that Metabase will only scan and cache the values of the field(s) that are used when a new filter is added to a dashboard or SQL question.
- **Never, I'll do this manually if I need to** is an option for databases that are either prohibitively large, or which never really have new values added. Use the [Re-scan field values now](#manually-scanning-column-values) button to run a manual scan and bring your filter values up to date.

### How database syncs work

A Metabase **sync** is a query that gets a list of updated table and view names, column names, and column data types from your database. This query runs against your database during setup, and again every hour by default. This scanning query is fast with most relational databases, but can be slower with MongoDB and some [community-built database drivers](../developers-guide/partner-and-community-drivers.md). Syncing can't be turned off completely, otherwise Metabase wouldn't work.

### How database scans work

A Metabase **scan** is a query that caches the column _values_ for filter dropdowns by looking at the first 1,000 distinct records from each table, in ascending order. For each record, Metabase only stores the first 100 kilobytes of text, so if you have data with 1,000 characters each (like addresses), and your column has more than 100 unique addresses, Metabase will only cache the first 100 values from the scan query.

Cached column values are displayed in filter dropdown menus. If people type in the filter search box for values that aren't in the first 1,000 distinct records or 100kB of text, Metabase will run a query against your database to look for those values on the fly.

A scan is more intensive than a sync query, so it only runs once during setup, and again once a day by default. If you [disable scans](#scheduling-database-scans) entirely, you'll need to bring things up to date by running [manual scans](#manually-scanning-column-values).

To reduce the number of tables and fields Metabase needs to scan in order to stay current with your connected database, Metabase will only scan values for fields that someone has queried in the last fourteen days.

### Manually syncing tables and columns

1. Go to **Admin settings** > **Databases** > your database.
2. Click on **Sync database schema now**.

### Manually scanning column values

To scan values from all the columns in a table:

1. Go to **Admin settings** > **Data model** > your database.
2. Select the table that you want to bring up to date with your database.
3. Click the **gear icon** at the top of the page.
4. Click **Re-scan this table**.

To scan values from a specific column:

1. Go to **Admin settings** > **Data model** > your database.
2. Select the table and find the column you want bring up to date with your database.
3. Click the **gear icon** in the panel for that column.
4. Click **Re-scan this field**.

### Clearing cached values

To forget the data that Metabase has stored from previous [database scans](#syncing-and-scanning-databases):

1. Go to **Admin settings** > **Data model** > your database.
2. Select the table.
3. Optional: select the column.
4. Click the **gear icon**.
5. Click **Discard cached field values**.

### Syncing and scanning using the API

Metabase syncs and scans regularly, but if the database administrator has just changed the database schema, or if a lot of data is added automatically at specific times, you may want to write a script that uses the [Metabase API](https://www.metabase.com/learn/administration/metabase-api) to force a sync or scan. [Our API](../api-documentation.md) provides two ways to initiate a sync or scan of a database:

1. Using a session token: the `/api/database/:id/sync_schema` or `api/database/:id/rescan_values` endpoints. These endpoints do the same things as going to the database in the Admin Panel and choosing **Sync database schema now** or **Re-scan field values now** respectively. To use these endpoints, you have to authenticate with a user ID and pass a session token in the header of your request.
2. Using an API key: `/api/notify/db/:id`. We created this endpoint so that people could notify their Metabase to sync after an [ETL operation](https://www.metabase.com/learn/analytics/etl-landscape) finishes. To use this endpoint, you must pass an API key by defining the `MB_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Deleting databases

**Caution: Deleting a database is irreversible! All saved questions and dashboard cards based on the database will be deleted as well!**

Go to **Admin settings** > **Databases** > your database and click **Remove this database**.

## Restoring the Sample Database

If you've deleted the Metabase [Sample Database](https://www.metabase.com/glossary/sample_database), go to **Admin settings** > **Databases** and click **Bring the Sample Database back**.
