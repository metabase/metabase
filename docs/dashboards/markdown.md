title: Text and markdown on dashboards
summary: Use markdown on dashboard to format text, add images,
---

Markdown can be used to:

- Add text to dashboards
- Format text on dashboard as headers, bold, italic, lists, code etc.
- Add images to dashboards
- Add links to dashboards

You can use variables in markdown to wire up your text cards to dashboard filters.

## Adding text to dashboards

Select a dashboard you'd like to add text to, and click on the **pencil icon** to edit the dashboard. Click on the **text box** button in the dashboard toolbar (shown as `Aa`). A text box will appear, which you can move around just as you would a question box. To resize the text box, click and drag on its bottom right corner.

## Writing in the text box

To interact with a text box, you'll need to be in edit mode in a dashboard. Click on the **pencil icon** in the dashboard toolbar in the upper right of the dashboard.

Text boxes in Metabase have two modes.

- Edit text (**pencil icon**).
- Rendered view (**eye icon**).

The text editor in Metabase employs a lightweight markup language called Markdown. If you've never used Markdown before, it takes some getting used to, but you'll soon learn to appreciate its simplicity. Markdown can make writers feel like coders and coders feel at home.

## How Markdown works

To create different heading levels like this:

![Headings as Metabase renders them in a text card on a dashboard.](../../../images/fun-with-markdown-in-your-dashboards/headings.png)

You'd write:

```md
# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6
```

The plain text `## Heading 2` is rendered as the HTML code:

```html
<h2>
  Heading
  <h2></h2>
</h2>
```

You can use Markdown syntax to add links, images, gifs, lists, codeblocks, blockquotes, and more. Here's a text box with heading, paragraph, blockquote, and code block:

![Heading, paragraph, and blockquote.](../../../images/fun-with-markdown-in-your-dashboards/heading-paragraph-blockquote.png)

You can do everything this post does and more using text boxes in Metabase. The big deal with Markdown is that you don't have to write tedious HTML, and Markdown is human-readable even before Metabase renders it. Markdown's minimalist feature set will keep you focused on the content, and provide a standardized look across your dashboards.

You can learn more about Markdown syntax [in this guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/), as well as from [one of Markdown's original creators](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), which also includes the [philosophy](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#philosophy) behind Markdown. As a bonus, the site allows you to view its content in [Markdown syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax.text).

## Example text box

Here is an example dashboard with a question and text box:

Here is the Markdown code used in the text box above:

```md
# Analysis

Although `Gadgets` outsold `Gizmos` in 2019, we only introduced `Gizmos` and `Doohickeys` in September of 2019. Additionally, both `Gadgets` and `Widgets` were heavily discounted during our spring, summer, and holiday sales.

We expect sales to continue to grow in the `Gizmo` and `Doohickey` product lines.

# SQL query

    SELECT "PRODUCTS__via__PRODUCT_ID"."CATEGORY" AS "CATEGORY",
    sum("PUBLIC"."ORDERS"."QUANTITY") AS "sum"
    FROM "PUBLIC"."ORDERS"
    LEFT JOIN "PUBLIC"."PRODUCTS" "PRODUCTS__via__PRODUCT_ID" ON
    "PUBLIC"."ORDERS"."PRODUCT_ID" = "PRODUCTS__via__PRODUCT_ID"."ID"
    WHERE ("PUBLIC"."ORDERS"."CREATED_AT" >= timestamp with time zone '2019-01-01 00:00:00.000Z'
    AND "PUBLIC"."ORDERS"."CREATED_AT" < timestamp with time zone '2020-01-01 00:00:00.000Z')
    GROUP BY "PRODUCTS__via__PRODUCT_ID"."CATEGORY"
    ORDER BY "sum" ASC, "PRODUCTS__via__PRODUCT_ID"."CATEGORY" ASC

The hypothetical analyst provided some context, code, and contact info: but you can include whatever context will help readers of your report.

Note: in the example above, the analyst pasted the raw SQL query generated by the query builder for reference. You can view the SQL composed by the query builder by clicking on the **editor icon** to ["View the SQL"](/docs/latest/questions/query-builder/editor#viewing-the-native-query-that-powers-your-question) when in editing mode.

You can also use text boxes as simple dividers to keep your dashboards organized.

## Use variables in text cards to create dynamic text

You can [add variables](/docs/latest/dashboards/introduction#including-variables-in-text-cards) to text cards and wire them up to filters. Metabase will take values selected in the filter and plug those values into variables in your text, creating text cards that update automatically when people change the filter values.

For example, let's say you want to have a text card display the values in the **Plan** filter on your dashboard, like so:

![Metabase rendering the two plans selected in the filter,](../../../images/fun-with-markdown-in-your-dashboards/rendered-parameters.png)

The plans listed in the text card will change depending on which plans are selected in the filter (in this case, the Business and Premium plans were selected in the filter, and so the text card displays them).

To wire up a text card variable to a filter:

1. Click the **pencil** icon to enter dashboard edit mode.
2. [Add a filter](/docs/latest/dashboards/filters#adding-a-filter-or-parameter) to your dashboard.
3. [Add a text card](/docs/latest/dashboards/introduction) to your dashboard.
4. Write some Markdown and include a variable. Variables are bookended with double braces:

   ```liquid
   {%raw%}# Plan
   ## {{PLAN}}{%endraw%}
   ```

5. [Connect the filter](/docs/latest/dashboards/filters#editing-a-filter) to the variable in the text card.

![Adding a variable to your text card.](../../../images/fun-with-markdown-in-your-dashboards/parameter.png)

If no value is plugged into the filter, Metabase will render the unsightly `{%raw%}{{PLAN}}{%endraw%}` variable. To handle cases where the filter has no value, you can set a default value or, better, hide the text by surrounding the variable text with double brackets to make the text optional.

```liquid
{%raw%}# Plan
[[## {{PLAN}}]]{%endraw%}
```

The double brackets tell Metabase to display the text only if the connected filter has at least one value.

## Create a custom URL with a filter value

You can add a URL to a Markdown card like this:

```md
[Google Search](https://google.com)
```

which will show up as the clickable hyperlink: [Google Search](https://google.com).

To make a dynamic URL, such as a [Google Search for "filter value"](https://google.com/search?q=filter_value), you can put a `{%raw%}{{variable}}{%endraw%}` wherever you want the filter value text to show up. For example, to add a dynamic URL to a dashboard with the **Invoices** table:

1. Create a dashboard filter for "Plan".
2. Add a Markdown card with your URL and variables:

   ```liquid
   [[ [Google Search for "{%raw%}{{plan}}{%endraw%}"](https://google.com/search?q={%raw%}{{plan}}{%endraw%}) ]]
   ```

3. [Connect the "Plan" filter to the Markdown card](/docs/latest/dashboards/filters#editing-a-filter).
4. Optional: set a default value for the "Plan" filter.

The outer double square brackets in the Markdown card text will hide the URL by default when the filter is empty (no value selected and no default value set).

![A custom URL that accepts a filter value.](../../../images/fun-with-markdown-in-your-dashboards/custom-url.png)

Now, if someone goes to the "Plan" filter and selects "Basic", they'll see a clickable link in the Markdown card like this: [Google Search for "Basic"](https://google.com?q=basic).

## Custom URL with a sandboxing attribute

{% include plans-blockquote.html feature="Data sandboxing" %}

Say you have a "department" attribute and you want to create a custom link to a user guide like this:

```md
[View Marketing guide](https://your-company-wiki.com/marketing)
```

To display custom URLs based on a person's [sandboxing attribute](/learn/metabase-basics/administration/permissions/data-sandboxing-row-permissions#creating-an-account-and-adding-an-attribute):

1. Create a dashboard filter for the sandboxing attribute.
2. Add a Markdown card with your URL and variables:

   ```liquid
   [[ [View {%raw%}{{department}}{%endraw%} guide](https://your-company-wiki.com/{%raw%}{{department}}{%endraw%}) ]]
   ```

3. [Connect the filter to the Markdown card](/docs/latest/dashboards/filters#editing-a-filter).

To hide the URL by default when the filter value is empty, make sure to include the outer double square brackets in the Markdown card text.

When a sandboxed user views the dashboard, they'll see:

- [View Marketing guide](/blog/why-a-growth-marketing-team-wants-metabase).
- A filter widget with the value "Marketing" (and no other selectable options).
- Dashboard data that's [sandboxed on rows](/learn/metabase-basics/administration/permissions/data-sandboxing-row-permissions) where "Department = Marketing".

If your dashboard is a static embed, you can opt to [hide the filter widget](/docs/latest/embedding/static-embedding-parameters#hiding-filter-widgets-from-a-static-embed).

## One last pro tip for GIF aficionados

The image syntax,

```md
![image description](image-link)
```

also works for GIFs. Because there are far more important use cases for dashboard text boxes:

Happy Markdowning!
