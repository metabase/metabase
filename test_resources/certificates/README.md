# Driver Testing Certificates

These are certificate files used for driver testing. They are kept separate from the `ssl` directory, which contains
various certificates related to hosting the Metabase app itself using self-signed SSL certs.

`us-east-2-bundle.pem` is the PEM certificate bundle for AWS `us-east-2`, fetched from
[here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/UsingWithRDS.SSL.html).
