            Review this pull request for compliance with project coding standards and conventions.

            **Use the appropriate review skill based on the file types changed:**
            - Use clojure-review for Clojure/ClojureScript files
            - Use typescript-review for TypeScript/JavaScript files
            - Follow the review guidelines and checklists in each skill

            DO NOT post any comments confirming that something is correct - only post comments for style violations or concerns.

            Note: The PR branch is already checked out in the current working directory.

            Use `gh pr comment` for top-level feedback.
            Use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to highlight specific code issues.
            Only post GitHub comments - don't submit review text as messages.
