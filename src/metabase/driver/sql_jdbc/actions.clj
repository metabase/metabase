;;; Why not just use [[jdbc/with-db-transaction]] to do this stuff? Why reinvent the wheel?
;;;
;;; There are a few reasons:
;;;
;;; 1. [[jdbc/with-db-transaction]] "absorbs" nested transactions, but this only works if you take the transaction
;;;    connection spec bound there and pass it around explicitly to subsequent calls to [[jdbc/with-db-transaction]].
;;;    This makes it hard to write bulk Actions as loops with repeated calls to single-row Actions. Of course, we could
;;;    just tweak the Actions so there was some way you could pass in an existing Connection or Connection spec for it
;;;    to use. But that would be a little more ugly and complicated than having a dynamic var. So we'd likely end up
;;;    with some sort of dynamic var and `with-` macro anyway to avoid repeated boilerplate. And it would likely make
;;;    [[do-nested-transaction]] harder to use or implement.
;;;
;;; 2. [[jdbc/with-db-transaction]] does a lot of magic that we don't necessarily want. Writing raw JDBC code is barely
;;;    any more cde and lets us have complete control over what happens and lets us see at a glance exactly what's
;;;    happening without having to keep [[clojure.java.jdbc]] magic in mind or work around it.

  Why do we need this?

  With things like bulk insert, we want to collect all the errors for all the rows in one go. Say you have 4 rows, 1 2
  3 and 4. If 1 errors then depending on the DBMS, the transaction enters an error state that disallows doing anything
  else. 2, 3, and 4 will error with a \"transaction has been aborted\" error that you can't clear (AFAIK). This
  affects Postgres but not H2. Not sure about other DBs yet.

  Without using nested transactions, if you have errors in rows 2 and 4 you'd only see the error in row 2 since 3 and
  4 would fail with \"transaction has been aborted\" or whatever.

  So the point of using nested transactions is that if 2 is done inside a nested transaction we can rollback the
  nested transaction which allows the top-level transaction to proceed even tho part of it errored."
