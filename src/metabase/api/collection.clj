  "`/api/collection` endpoints. By default, these endpoints operate on Collections in the 'default' namespace, which is
  the one that has things like Dashboards and Cards. Other namespaces of Collections exist as well, such as the
  `:snippet` namespace, (called 'Snippet folders' in the UI). These namespaces are completely independent hierarchies.
  To use these endpoints for other Collections namespaces, you can pass the `?namespace=` parameter (e.g.
  `?namespace=snippet`)."

  The first rule is absolutely necessary, as queries violating it cannot be executed without

  outside of optional blocks ([[ ... ]]) don't prevent the query from being executed without
  external parameter values (neither do parameters in optional blocks). The rule has been added
  nonetheless, because marking a parameter as required is something the user does intentionally
  and queries that are technically executable without parameters can be unacceptably slow
