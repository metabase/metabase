/**
 * Get a sequence of columns that can be used as the left-hand-side (source column) in a join condition. This column
 * is the one that comes from the source Table/Card/previous stage of the query or a previous join.
 *
 * If you are changing the LHS of a condition for an existing join, pass in that existing join as `joinOrJoinable` so
 * we can filter out the columns added by it (it doesn't make sense to present the columns added by a join as options
 * for its own LHS) or added by later joins (joins can only depend on things from previous joins). Otherwise you can
 * either pass in `nil` or the `Joinable` (Table or Card metadata) we're joining against when building a new
 * join. (Things other than joins are ignored, but this argument is flexible for consistency with the signature
 * of `joinConditionRHSColumns`.) See #32005 for more info.
 *
 * If the left-hand-side column has already been chosen and we're UPDATING it, pass in `lhs-column-or-nil` so we can
 * mark the current column as `:selected` in the metadata/display info.
 *
 * If the right-hand-side column has already been chosen (they can be chosen in any order in the Query Builder UI),
 * pass in the chosen RHS column. In the future, this may be used to restrict results to compatible columns. (See #31174)
 *
 * Results will be returned in a 'somewhat smart' order with PKs and FKs returned before other columns.
 *
 * Unlike most other things that return columns, implicitly-joinable columns ARE NOT returned here.

/**
 * Get the display name for whatever we are joining. See #32015 and #32764 for screenshot examples.
 *
 * The rules, copied from MLv1, are as follows:
 *
 * 1. If we have the LHS column for the first join condition, we should use display name for wherever it comes from.
 *    E.g. if the join is
 *
 *    ```
 *    JOIN whatever ON orders.whatever_id = whatever.id
 *    ```
 *
 *    then we should display the join like this:
 *
 *   ```
 *   +--------+   +----------+    +-------------+    +----------+
 *   | Orders | + | Whatever | on | Orders      | =  | Whatever |
 *   |        |   |          |    | Whatever ID |    | ID       |
 *   +--------+   +----------+    +-------------+    +----------+
 *   ```
 *
 *   1a. If `joinOrJoinable` is a join, we can take the condition LHS column from the join itself, since a join will
 *       always have a condition.
 *
 *   1b. When building a join, you can optionally pass in `conditionLHSColumn` yourself.
 *
 * 2. If the condition LHS column is unknown, and this is the first join in the first stage of a query, and the query
 *    uses a source Table, then use the display name for the source Table.
 *
 * 3. Otherwise use `Previous results`.
 *
 * This function needs to be usable while we are in the process of constructing a join in the context of a given stage,
 * but also needs to work for rendering existing joins. Pass a join in for existing joins, or something [[Joinable]]
 * for ones we are currently building.
