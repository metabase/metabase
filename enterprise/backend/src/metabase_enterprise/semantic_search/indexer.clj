(ns metabase-enterprise.semantic-search.indexer
  "Companion to the gate lib defining an indexing loop to be invoked as a singleton Quartz job.

  - A (cluster singleton) interruptible quartz job should invoke (quartz-job-run!) (see task/indexer.clj).
  - The job will poll the gate table in a loop and index anything new it finds (inserts, updates & deletes).
  - Occasionally (scheduled according to demand) will drain some records from the dead letter queue and try attempt to reindex them (see dlq.clj).
  - Saves watermark state back to index metadata for each batch of documents indexed
    (if interrupted / crashes / process dies, polling can continue from its watermark position).
  - The job can run the indexing-loop for a time, eventually yielding back to quartz.
    - we do not poll once per job invocation, indexing-loop can poll and index data many, many times before yielding.
    - it will exit if it has run for default-max-run-duration
    - it will exit if it has not seen any new data in default-exit-early-cold-duration
    - it will exit if it is interrupted (e.g. node shutdown).
  - Polling behaviour respects the limitations of gate.clj (there is a 2x gate-write-timeout lag tolerance).
    - if there is a lot of new write activity you might see the indexer stall for a short time
      to wait for commit-races to become very unlikely.
    - when reindexing cold gate entries the loop is free to index using straightforward key-set pagination, without waiting.
  - By default, any kind of exception will immediately exit the loop (quartz is free to reschedule).
  - If the indexer is deemed to have stalled due to repeated errors:
      - The loop will instead start adding failed gate docs to the dead-letter-queue (see dlq.clj).
      - Progress its watermark regardless (to avoid indexer stalls if e.g. documents are poisoned)."
