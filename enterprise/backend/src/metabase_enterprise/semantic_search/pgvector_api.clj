(ns metabase-enterprise.semantic-search.pgvector-api
  "High-level API for pgvector based semantic search over metabase.search documents.

  Provides the primary interface for search, indexing, and document management.

  Determines which index to target in the database using the index-metadata lib.

  Important: The pgvector database must be setup for metadata by calling (init-semantic-search!)
  After this, the document management and query functions will work as long as you pass the same index-metadata configuration."
