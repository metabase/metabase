title: "Preview embed"
summary: |
  Endpoints for previewing how Cards and Dashboards will look when embedding them.
     These endpoints are basically identical in functionality to the ones in `/api/embed`, but:
  
     1.  Require admin access
     2.  Ignore the values of `:enabled_embedding` for Cards/Dashboards
     3.  Ignore the `:embed_params` whitelist for Card/Dashboards, instead using a field called `:_embedding_params` in
         the JWT token itself.
  
     Refer to the documentation for those endpoints for further details.
