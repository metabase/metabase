  "Fetch a [[java.sql.Connection]] from a `driver`/`db-or-id-or-spec`, and invoke

    (f connection)

  If `db-or-id-or-spec` is a Database or Database ID, the default implementation fetches a pooled connection spec for
  that Database using [[datasource]].

  If `db-or-id-or-spec` is a `clojure.java.jdbc` spec, it fetches a Connection
  using [[clojure.java..jdbc/get-connection]]. Note that this will not be a pooled connection unless your spec is for
  a pooled DataSource.

  `options` matches the [[ConnectionOptions]] schema above.

  * If `:session-timezone` is passed, it should be used to set the Session timezone for the Connection. If not passed,
    leave as-is

  * If `:write?` is NOT passed or otherwise falsey, make the connection read-only if possible; if it is truthy, make
    the connection read-write. Note that this current does not run things inside a transaction automatically; you'll
    have to do that yourself if you want it

  The normal 'happy path' is more or less

    (with-open [conn (.getConnection (datasource driver db-or-id-or-spec))]
      (set-best-transaction-level! driver conn)
      (set-time-zone-if-supported! driver conn session-timezone)
      (.setReadOnly conn true)
      (.setAutoCommit conn true) ; so the query(s) are not ran inside a transaction
      (.setHoldability conn ResultSet/CLOSE_CURSORS_AT_COMMIT)
      (f conn))

  This default implementation is abstracted out into two functions, [[do-with-resolved-connection]]
  and [[set-default-connection-options!]], that you can use as needed in custom implementations. See various driver
  implementations for examples. You should only set connection options on top-level calls
  to [[do-with-connection-with-options]]; check whether this is a [[recursive-connection?]] before setting options.

  There are two usual ways to set the session timezone if your driver supports them:

  1. Specifying the session timezone based on the value of [[metabase.driver/report-timezone]] as a JDBC connection
     parameter in the JDBC connection spec returned by [[metabase.driver.sql-jdbc.connection/connection-details->spec]].
     If the spec returned by this method changes, connection pools associated with it will be flushed automatically.
     This is the preferred way to set session timezones; if you set them this way, you DO NOT need to implement this
     method unless you need to do something special with regards to setting the transaction level.

  2. Setting the session timezone manually on the [[java.sql.Connection]] returned by [[datasource]] based on the
     value of `session-timezone`.

    2a. The default implementation will do this for you by executing SQL if you implement
        [[set-timezone-sql]].

    2b. You can implement this method, [[do-with-connection-with-options]], yourself and set the timezone however you
        wish. Only set it if `session-timezone` is not `nil`!

   Custom implementations should set transaction isolation to the least-locking level supported by the driver, and make
   connections read-only (*after* setting timezone, if needed)."
