  ;; and expressions could return the wrong results because of limits being applied to subselects. Realistically the
  ;; overriden limit of `0` should probably only apply to the MBQL query and not to the number of rows we take. But we'd
  ;; have to break [[determine-query-max-rows]] into two separate things in order to do that. :shrug:
