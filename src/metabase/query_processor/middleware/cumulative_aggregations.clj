(ns metabase.query-processor.middleware.cumulative-aggregations
  "Middlware for handling cumulative count and cumulative sum aggregations in Clojure-land. In 0.50.0+, this middleware
  is only used for drivers that do not have native implementations of `:window-functions/cumulative`; see the driver
  changelog for 0.50.0 for more information.

  For queries with more than one breakout, we reset the totals every time breakouts other than the first one change,
  e.g.

    date       city  count cumulative_count
    2024-01-01 LBC   10    10
    2024-01-02 LBC   2     12
    2024-01-02 LBC   4     16
    2024-01-01 SF    3     3
    2024-01-01 SF    1     4
    2024-01-02 SF    2     6

  Rather than doing a cumulative sum across the entire set of query results -- see #2862 and #42003 for more
  information."
