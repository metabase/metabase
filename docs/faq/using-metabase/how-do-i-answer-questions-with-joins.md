# How do I answer questions where I need to join tables together?

If you are using a Metabase version earlier than 0.33, you will need to either write a SQL query that contains joins, or have your Metabase administrator set up foreign keys (they can read more about that [here](../../administration-guide/03-metadata-editing.md)).

If you are using Metabase 0.33 or above, you can [perform joins using the Notebook editor](https://www.metabase.com/blog/joining-tables/index.html).
