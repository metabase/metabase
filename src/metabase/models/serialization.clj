;;; # Serialization Overview
;;;
;;; Serialization (or "serdes") is a system for exporting entities (Dashboards, Cards, Collections, etc.) from one
;;; Metabase instance to disk files, and later importing them into 1 or more separate Metabase instances.
;;;
;;; There are two versions of serdes, known as v1 and v2. v2 was built in late 2022 to solve some problems with v1,
;;; especially: accidentally duplicating entities because of a human change like renaming a collection; and that several
;;; newly added models (eg. Timelines) were not added to serdes. v1's code is in `metabase-enterprise.serialization.*`;
;;; v2 is split between infrastructure in `metabase-enterprise.serialization.v2.*` and integration with each model in
;;; `metabase.models.*`.
;;;
;;; There are tests which query the set of Toucan models and ensure that they either support serialization or are
;;; explicitly listed as exempt. Therefore serdes for new models is not forgotten.
;;;
;;; ## More details
;;; This file is probably best not read top to bottom - it's organized in `def` order, not necessarily a good order for
;;; understanding. Probably you want to read below on the "Export process" and "Import process" next.


;;; # Entity IDs
;;; Every serializable entity needs the be identified in a way that is:
;;;
;;; 1. unique, at least among the serialized entities
;;; 2. permanent, even if eg. a collection's `:name` changes
;;; 3. portable between Metabase instances and over time
;;;
;;; Database primary keys fail (3); matching based on the value fails (2) and maybe (1). So there's no easy way to solve
;;; this requirement. We've taken three approaches for different kinds of entities:
;;;
;;; 1. Some have unique names already and we can use those: Databases are uniquely named and don't change.
;;;     - Some are unique within a namespace: Fields are unique in Tables, Tables in Schemas, Schemas in Databases.
;;; 2. Some are "embedded" as part of a parent entity, and don't need to exist independently, eg. the recipients of a
;;;    pulse/dashboard subscription are reduced to a list of email addresses.
;;; 3. For everything else (Dashboards, Cards, etc.)
;;;    - Add an `entity_id` column to the tables
;;;    - Populate it `on-insert` with a randomly-generated NanoID like `"V1StGXR8_Z5jdHi6B-myT"`.
;;;    - For entities that existed before the column was added, have a portable way to rebuild them (see below on
;;;      hashing).

(defmulti entity-id
  "Given the model name and an entity, returns its entity ID (which might be nil).

  This abstracts over the exact definition of the \"entity ID\" for a given entity.
  By default this is a column, `:entity_id`.

  Models that have a different portable ID (`Database`, `Field`, etc.) should override this."

  (fn [model-name _instance] model-name))

(defmethod entity-id :default [_ {:keys [entity_id]}]
  (str/trim entity_id))

;;; ## Hashing entities
;;; In the worst case, an entity is already present in two instances linked by serdes, and it doesn't have `entity_id`
;;; set because it existed before we added the column. If we write a migration to just generate random `entity_id`s on
;;; both sides, those entities will get duplicated on the next `import`.
;;;
;;; So every entity implements [[hash-fields]], which determines the set of fields whose values are used to generate the
;;; hash. The 32-bit [[identity-hash]] is then used to seed the PRNG and generate a "random" NanoID. Since this is based
;;; on properties of the entity, it is reproducible on both `export` and `import` sides, so entities are not duplicated.
;;;
;;; Before any `export` or `import`, [[metabase-enterprise.serialization.v2.backfill-ids/backfill-ids]] is called. It
;;; does `SELECT * FROM SomeModel WHERE entity_id IS NULL` and populates all the blanks with this hash-based NanoID.
;;;
;;; <h3>Whoops, two kinds of backfill</h3>
;;; Braden discovered in Nov 2023 that for more than a year, we've had two inconsistent ways to backfill all the
;;; `entity_id` fields in an instance.
;;;
;;; 1. The one described above, [[metabase-enterprise.serialization.v2.backfill-ids/backfill-ids]] which runs before
;;;    any export or import.
;;; 2. A separate JAR command `seed_entity_ids` which is powered by
;;;    [[metabase-enterprise.serialization.v2.entity-ids/seed-entity-ids!]] and uses the [[identity-hash]] hex strings
;;;    directly rather than seeding a NanoID with them.
;;;
;;; Therefore the import machinery has to look out for both kinds of IDs and use them. This is foolish and should be
;;; simplified. We should write a Clojure-powered migration that finds any short 8-character `entity_id`s and generates
;;; NanoIDs from them.

;;; # Serdes paths and <tt>:serdes/meta</tt>
;;; The Clojure maps from extraction and ingestion always include a special key `:serdes/meta` giving some information
;;; about the serialized entity. The value is always a vector of maps that give a "path" to the entity. This is **not**
;;; a filesystem path; rather it defines the nesting of some entities inside others.
;;;
;;; Most paths are a single layer:
;;; `[{:model "ModelName" :id "entity ID" :label "Human-readonly name"}]`
;;; where `:model` and `:id` are required, and `:label` is optional.
;;;
;;; But for some entities, it can be deeper. For example, Fields belong to Tables, which are in Schemas, which are in
;;; Databases. (Schemas don't exist separately in the appdb, but they're used here to keep Table names unique.)
;;; For example:
;;; <pre><code>[{:model "Database" :id "my_db"}
;;;  {:model "Schema"   :id "PUBLIC"}
;;;  {:model "Table"    :id "Users"}
;;;  {:model "Field"    :id "email"}]</code></pre>
;;;
;;; Many of the serdes multimethods are keyed on the `:model` field of the leaf entry (the last).

;;; # Export Process
;;; An *export* (writing a Metabase instance's entities to disk) happens in two stages: *extraction* and *storage*.
;;; These are independent, and deliberately decoupled. The result of extraction is a reducible stream of Clojure maps,
;;; each with `:serdes/meta` keys on them (see below about these paths). In particular, note that extraction happens
;;; inside Clojure, and has nothing to do with file formats or anything of the kind.
;;;
;;; Storage takes the stream of extracted entities and actually stores it to disk or sends it over the network.
;;; Traditionally we serialize to a directory of YAML files, and that's the only storage approach currently implemented.
;;; But since the export process is split into (complicated) extraction and (straightforward) storage, we or a user
;;; could write a new storage layer fairly easily if we wanted to use JSON, protocol buffers, or any other format.
;;;
;;; Both extraction and storage are written as a set of multimethods, with defaults for the common case.
;;;
;;; ## Extraction
;;; Extraction is controlled by a map of options and settings, with details below.
;;;
;;; - [[metabase-enterprise.serialization.v2.models/exported-models]] gives the set of models to be exported.
;;;     - A test enforces that all models are either exported or explicitly excluded, so we can't forget serdes for new
;;;       models.
;;; - [[metabase-enterprise.serialization.v2.extract/extract]] is the entry point for extraction.
;;;     - It can work in a "selective" mode or extract everything; see below on selective serialization.
;;; - It calls `(extract-all "ModelName" opts)` for each model.
;;;     - By default this calls `(extract-query "ModelName" opts)`, getting back a reducible stream of entities.
;;;     - For each entity in that stream, it calls `(extract-one "ModelName" entity)`, which converts the map from the
;;;       database (with instance-specific FKs in it) to a portable map with `:serdes/meta` on it and all FKs replaced
;;;       with portable references.
;;;
;;; The default [[extract-all]] works for nearly all models. Override [[extract-query]] if you need to control which
;;; entities get serialized (eg. to exclude `archived` ones). Every model implements [[extract-one]] to make its
;;; entities portable.
;;;
;;; ## Storage
;;; Storage transforms the reducible stream in some arbitrary way. It returns nothing; storage is expected to have side
;;; effects like writing files to disk or transmitting them over the network.
;;;
;;; Not all storage implementations use directory structure, but for those that do [[storage-path]] should give the path
;;; for an entity as a list of strings: `["foo" "bar" "some_file"]`. Note the lack of a file extension! That is
;;; deliberately left off the shared [[storage-path]] code so it can be set by different implementations to `.yaml`,
;;; `.json`, etc.
;;;
;;; By convention, models are named as *plural* and in *lower case*:
;;; `["collections" "1234ABC_my_collection" "dashboards" "8765def_health_metrics"]`.
;;;
;;; As a final remark, note that some entities have their own directories and some do not. For example, a Field is
;;; simply a file, while a Table has a directory. So a subset of the tree might look something like this:
;;; <pre><code>my-export/
;;; ├── collections
;;; └── databases
;;;     └── Sample Database
;;;         ├── Sample Database.yaml
;;;         └── schemas
;;;             └── PUBLIC
;;;                 └── tables
;;;                     └── ORDERS
;;;                         ├── ORDERS.yaml
;;;                         └── fields
;;;                             ├── CREATED_AT.yaml
;;;                             ├── DISCOUNT.yaml
;;;                             ├── ID.yaml
;;;                             ├── PRODUCT_ID.yaml

;;;                             ├── TAX.yaml
;;;                             ├── TOTAL.yaml
;;;                             └── USER_ID.yaml
;;; </code></pre>
;;;
;;; ## Selective serialization
;;; It's common to only export certain entities from an instance, rather than everything. We might export a single
;;; Question, or a Dashboard with all its DashboardCards and their Cards.
;;;
;;; There's a relation to be captured here: the *descendants* of an entity are the ones it semantically "contains", or
;;; those it needs in order to be executed. (As when a question depends on another, or a SQL question references a
;;; NativeQuerySnippet.
;;;
;;; [[descendants]] returns a set of such descendants for a given entity; see there for more details.
;;;
;;; *Note:* "descendants" and "dependencies" are quite different things!

;;; # Import Process
;;; Deserialization is split into two stages, mirroring serialization. They are called *ingestion* and *loading*.
;;; Ingestion turns whatever serialized form was produced by storage (eg. a tree of YAML files) into Clojure maps with
;;; `:serdes/meta` maps. Loading imports these entities into the appdb, updating and inserting rows as needed.
;;;
;;; ## Ingestion
;;; Ingestion is intended to be a black box, like storage above.
;;; [[metabase-enterprise.serialization.v2.ingest/Ingestable]] is defined as a protocol to allow easy [[reify]] usage
;;; for testing deserialization in memory.
;;;
;;; Factory functions consume some details (like a path to the export) and return an `Ingestable` instance, with its
;;; two methods:
;;;
;;; - `(ingest-list ingestable)` returns a reducible stream of `:serdes/meta` paths in any order.
;;; - `(ingest-one ingestable meta-path)` ingests a single entity into memory, returning it as a map.
;;;
;;; This two-stage design avoids needing all the data in memory at once. (Assuming the underlying storage media is
;;; something like files, and not a network stream that won't wait!)
;;;
;;; ## Loading
;;; Loading tries to find, for each ingested entity, a corresponding entity in the destination appdb, using the entity
;;; IDs. If it finds a match, that row will be `UPDATE`d, rather than `INSERT`ing a duplicate.
;;;
;;; The entry point is [[metabase-enterprise.serialization.v2.load/load-metabase]].
;;;
;;; First, `(ingest-list ingestable)` gets the `:serdes/meta` "path" for every exported entity in arbitrary order.
;;; Then for each ingested entity:
;;;
;;; - `(ingest-one serdes-path opts)` is called to read the value into memory, then
;;; - `(dependencies ingested)` gets a list of other `:serdes/meta` paths need to be loaded first.
;;;     - See below on depenencies.
;;; - Dependencies are loaded recursively in postorder; that is an entity is loaded after all its deps.
;;;     - Circular dependencies will make the load process throw.
;;; - Once an entity's deps are all loaded, we check for an existing one:
;;;     - `(load-find-local serdes-path)` returns the corresponding entity, or nil.
;;; - `(load-one! ingested maybe-local-entity)` is called with the `ingested` map and `nil` or the local match.
;;;     - `load-one!` is a side-effecting black box to the rest of the deserialization process.
;;;     - `load-one! returns the primary key of the new or existing entity, which is necessary to resolve foreign keys.
;;;
;;; `load-one!` has a default implementation that works for most models:
;;;
;;; - Call `(load-xform ingested)` to transform the ingested map as needed.
;;;     - Override [[load-xform]] to convert any foreign keys from portable entity IDs to the local database FKs.
;;; - Then call either:
;;;     - `(load-update! ingested local-entity)` if the local entity exists, or
;;;     - `(load-insert! ingested)` if it's new.
;;;
;;; Both `load-update!` and `load-insert!` have the obvious defaults of updating or inserting with Toucan, but they
;;; can be overridden if special handling is needed.

;;; depends on the `Table`s it queries, the `Collection` it belongs to, and possibly much else.
