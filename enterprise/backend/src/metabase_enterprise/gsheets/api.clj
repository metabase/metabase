;; # Google Sheets Integration
;;
;; ## Overview
;; Google Sheets Integration allows users to connect their Google Drive folders to Metabase. We sync any Google Sheets
;; inside of those folders, and make them available to the user in their attached data warehouse. This integration is
;; implemented using Harbormaster, which is a service that manages instances of Metabase and also gives us a connection
;; to Google Sheets data. When a user connects a Google Drive folder to Metabase, Harbormaster creates a connection to
;; the folder and starts syncing the data to Metabase. This data is then available to the user in Metabase as tables.
;;
;; ## Steps to connect a new google drive folder
;;
;; - An admin clicks Add Data > Connect Google Sheets
;; - FE sends :get "api/ee/gsheets/service-account" to get service-account email
;;   - If the FE cannot find the service-account email, it does not show the "connect to google sheets" (ctgs) button.
;; - user clicks ctgs button -> FE shows instructions for how to connect a folder:
;;   - user shares their Google Drive folder w/ service-account email
;;   - user copies their Google Drive share link into MB form and hits submit
;; - FE sends :post "api/ee/gsheets/folder" w/ folder url string as `request.body.url`
;;   - BE forwards request to :post "/api/v2/mb/connections" w/ body:
;;     `{:type "gdrive" :secret {:resources ["the-url"]}}`
;;     - on unexceptional status:
;;       - BE sets `gsheets.status` to `"loading"`
;;       - BE returns the gsheets shape: `{:status "loading" :folder_url "the-url" :folder-upload-time <epoch-time> :gdrive/conn-id <uuid>}}`
;;     - on exceptional status, BE returns a message like: "Unable to setup drive folder sync. Please check that the
;;       folder is shared with the proper service account email and sharing permissions."
;;
;; ## Polling
;; - FE polls :get "api/ee/gsheets/folder" until `body.status` == `complete`
;; - BE forwards requests to :get "/api/v2/mb/connection/<gdrive-conn-id>", filtering for the google drive connection
;;   - If the connection doesn't exist: `{:error "google drive connection not found."}`
;;   - If the connection exists and is NOT active, return loading state in the response
;;   - If the connection exists and is active AND the latest sync of the attached datawarehouse is AFTER the sync time
;;         on Harbormaster's gdrive connection, return `body.status` == "complete".
;; - FE sees status == "complete"
;;
;; ### What does "complete" mean?
;; When the status is "complete", the user can access their google sheets info inside Metabase.
;; This means that both:
;; 1. the gdrive connection has been marked active
;; 2. the attached datawarehouse has completed syncing inside metabase
;; To check this, we compare the last sync time of the attached datawarehouse with the last sync time of the gdrive.
;;
;; ### What if the sync takes too long or never ends?
;; Upon the successful creation of a gdrive connection, we start a timer that will error out if the sync does not
;; complete within [[*folder-setup-timeout-seconds*]] seconds. If the sync does not complete within this window, we
;; reset the gsheets status to `{:status "not-connected"}` and return an error for the FE to show.
;;
;; ## Steps to disconnect a google drive folder
;; - FE sends request to :delete "/folder"
;;   - MB loops over all gdrive connection ids and deletes them
;;
;; ## Why do we need to sync the attached datawarehouse before considering it ready?
;; We need to sync the attached datawarehouse to make sure that the data from the Google Drive folder is available to
;; the user in Metabase. Once the gdrive connection's status is set to 'active' by HM, they will call MB's
;; `api/notify/db/attached_datawarehouse` endpoint to trigger a sync. The data from the Google Drive folder is already
;; availiable in the attached datawarehouse, and when MB finishes the sync (and puts an item into :model/TaskHistory
;; saying so), the user can start using their Google Sheets data in Metabase.
;;
;; ## Why do we check for multiple gdrive connections in the delete endpoint? We check for multiple gdrive connections
;; in the delete endpoint to make sure that we are deleting _all_ gdrive connections. As of Milestone 2 there is
;; supposed to be only one gdrive connection, but we observed multiple being created (distributed systems amirite?) and
;; want the delete endpoint to basically reset us to a blank slate. If there are multiple gdrive connections, we will
;; delete all of them. If there are errors during the gdrive conn deletion we ignore them.
