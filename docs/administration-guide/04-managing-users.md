* New users will receive an email welcoming them to Metabase and a link to configure their password.
* To delete a user's account, click **Remove**.  Deleting an account will mark it as inactive and prevent it from being used in the future - but it won't delete the user's cards or dashboards.

* To make an existing user an administrator, click **Grant Admin**
* To remove administrator privileges from a user, select **Revoke Admin**
