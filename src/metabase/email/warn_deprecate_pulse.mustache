<p>Hi {{userName}},</p>
<p>We deprecated Pulses in Metabase 0.38, two years ago.</p>
<p>Now the time has come to remove them.</p>
<p>On the next release, we will delete all Pulses and keep only Dashboard Subscriptions.</p>
<p>These are the active Pulses you have:</p>
<ul>
  {{#pulses}}
    <li><a href="{{url}}">{{name}}</a></li>
  {{/pulses}}
</ul>
<p>You can transform legacy Pulses into Dashboard Subscriptions following <a href="https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/questions/sharing/pulses">this doc</a>.</p>
<p>This message was sent to all Admins of <a href="{{instanceURL}}">{{instanceURL}}</a>.</p>
<p>Onward!</p>
<p>- The Metabase Team</p>
