# Troubleshooting permissions

If someone has the wrong level of access to a dashboard or a question, the problem may be coming from group settings, collection permissions, or data permissions.

1. Go to **Admin** > **People** and check if the person is in [more than one group with different permissions][group-permissions].
2. If a person **can't view or edit** questions or dashboards, see [Troubleshooting collection permissions](#troubleshooting-collection-permissions).
3. If a person **can't access data**, such as schema, tables, rows, or columns, see [Troubleshooting data permissions](#troubleshooting-data-permissions).

If you have a different issue, see [related problems](#do-you-have-a-different-problem).

## Troubleshooting collection permissions

- [A user group can't access a dashboard in a collection that they have permissions for][troubleshooting-viewing-editing].
- [A user group can view collections that contain restricted data][collections-restricted-data].

## [Troubleshooting data permissions][troubleshooting-data-permissions]

### Row and column permissions

- [Troubleshooting data sandboxing][troubleshooting-data-sandboxing].

### Native query (SQL) permissions

- [A user group can't access the SQL editor][sql-access].
- [A user group with SQL permissions isn't being restricted by their data sandbox][sql-sandboxing].

### Table or schema permissions

- [A user group has the wrong access to a table or schema][table-schema-access].
- [Getting a "permission denied" error message][permission-denied].
- [Checking someone's access to a table or schema](./data-permissions.md#checking-someones-access-to-a-table-or-schema)


## Do you have a different problem?

- [I can't save my question or dashboard][proxies].
- [I can't see my tables](./cant-see-tables.md).

## Are you still stuck?

If you canâ€™t solve your problem using the troubleshooting guides:

- Search or ask the [Metabase community][discourse].
