(s/defn ^:private delete-related-permissions!
  "This is somewhat hard to explain, but I will do my best:

  Delete all 'related' permissions for `group-or-id` (i.e., perms that grant you full or partial access to `path`).
  This includes *both* ancestor and descendant paths. For example:

  Suppose we asked this functions to delete related permssions for `/db/1/schema/PUBLIC/`. Dependning on the
  permissions the group has, it could end up doing something like:

    *  deleting `/db/1/` permissions (because the ancestor perms implicity grant you full perms for `schema/PUBLIC`)
    *  deleting perms for `/db/1/schema/PUBLIC/table/2/` (because Table 2 is a descendant of `schema/PUBLIC`)

  In short, it will delete any permissions that contain `/db/1/schema/` as a prefix, or that themeselves are prefixes
  for `/db/1/schema/`.

  You can optionally include `other-conditions`, which are anded into the filter clause, to further restrict what is
  deleted.

  NOTE: This function is meant for internal usage in this namespace only; use one of the other functions like
  `revoke-permissions!` elsewhere instead of calling this directly."
