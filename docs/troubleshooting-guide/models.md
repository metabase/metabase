# Troubleshooting models

What kind of problem are you having with your [model][model-docs]?

- [Can't create a model](#cant-create-a-model).
- [Can't edit or save changes to a model](#cant-edit-or-save-changes-to-a-model).
- [Model performance is poor](#model-performance-is-poor).
- [Model doesn't work with data sandboxing][troubleshooting-sandboxing].

## Can't create a model

If you don't see [the model button][model-button-image] (three squares):

1. Check if you're using a Metabase version that's 0.42.0 or greater from the **gear icon** > **About Metabase**.
2. Clear your browser cache.
3. Ask your Metabase admin to clear the proxy cache (if you're using one).
4. Ask your Metabase admin if [nested queries are enabled][nested-query-settings-docs] under **Admin** > **Settings** > **General**.

## Can't edit or save changes to a model

If your changes to a model's metadata or underlying question aren't showing up:

1. Refresh your browser to confirm you're not viewing cached results.
2. Search for [known model issues][known-issues-models] using the label `Querying/Models`. For more information, go to [How to find a known bug or limitation][known-issues].

## Model performance is poor

1. Optimize the underlying saved question or SQL query.

    - [Ask for less data][limit-data-learn].
    - For models that use SQL questions, [look for bottlenecks using SQL EXPLAIN][sql-explain-learn].

2. Optimize your database schemas.

    - [Aggregate data ahead of time with summary tables][summary-tables-learn].
    - [Index frequently queried columns][indexes-learn].
    - [Denormalize your data][denormalize-data-learn].
    - [Materialize views][materialize-views-learn].
    - [Pull data out of JSON and slot its keys into columns][flatten-json-learn].

3. Optimize your data warehouse(s) or database(s).

    - [Replicate your database][replicate-database-learn].
    - [Consider a database optimized for analytics][analytics-database-learn].

**Explanation**

Models are a type of saved question, so they will only perform as fast as the original question or SQL query.

If you want to improve the performance of a model, you can make optimizations at the query, schema, or database level (depending on your data permissions, technical expertise, and willingness to tinker).

## Are you still stuck?

If you canâ€™t solve your problem using the troubleshooting guides:

- Search or ask the [Metabase community][discourse].
- Search for [known model issues][known-issues-models] using the label `Querying/Models`. For more information, go to [How to find a known bug or limitation][known-issues].
