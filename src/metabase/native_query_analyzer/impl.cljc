    ;; According to the SQL-92 specification, non-quoted identifiers should be case-insensitive, and the majority of
    ;; engines are implemented this way.
    ;;
    ;; In practice there are exceptions, notably MySQL and SQL Server, where case sensitivity is a property of the
    ;; underlying resource referenced by the identifier, and the case-sensitivity does not depend on whether the
    ;; reference is quoted.
    ;;
    ;; For MySQL the case sensitivity of databases and tables depends on both the underlying file system, and a system
    ;; variable used to initialize the database. For SQL Server it depends on the collation settings of the collection
    ;; where the corresponding schema element is defined.
    ;;
    ;; For MySQL, columns and aliases can never be case-sensitive, and for SQL Server the default collation is case-
    ;; insensitive too, so it makes sense to just treat all databases as case-insensitive as a whole.
    ;;
    ;; In future, Macaw may support discriminating on the identifier type, in which case we could be more precise for
    ;; these databases. Being 100% correct would require querying system variables and schema configuration however,
    ;; which is likely a step too far in complexity.
    ;;
    ;; Currently, we go with :agnostic, as it is the most relaxed semantics (the case of both the identifiers and the
    ;; underlying schema is totally ignored, and correspondence is non-deterministic), but Macaw supports more nuanced
    ;; :lower and :upper configuration values which coerce the query identifiers to a given case then do an exact
    ;; comparison with the schema.
