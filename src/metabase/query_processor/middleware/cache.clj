(ns metabase.query-processor.middleware.cache
  "Middleware that returns cached results for queries when applicable.

  If caching is enabled (`enable-query-caching` is `true`) cached results will be returned for Cards if possible.
  There's a global default TTL defined by the setting `query-caching-default-ttl`, but individual Cards can override
  this value with custom TTLs with a value for `:cache_ttl`.

  For all other queries, caching is skipped.

  The default backend is `db`, which uses the application database; this value can be changed by setting the env var
  `MB_QP_CACHE_BACKEND`. Refer to `metabase.query-processor.middleware.cache-backend.interface` for more details about
  how the cache backends themselves."
