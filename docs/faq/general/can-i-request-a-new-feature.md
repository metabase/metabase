# Can I request a new feature?

Absolutely! New features can be added as [issues in our Github repo][github-issues]. Before filing, please take a minute to search and see if your feature has already been requested. If it has, it's better to add a thumbs up on the existing issue than to file a new one. (We use thumbs up to measure how interested our community is in new features, so it's better to have them all in one place.)
