  "Code related to calculating result metadata as returned by the Query Processor. This differs from the normal
  [[metabase.lib.metadata.calculation/returned-columns]] a bit, mostly for historical reasons. Hopefully as time moves
  on we can bring this closer and closer to the metadata returned by `returned-columns`. Unlike `returned-columns`,
  this only works on the last stage of the query.

  Traditionally this code lived in the [[metabase.query-processor.middleware.annotate]] namespace, where it is still
