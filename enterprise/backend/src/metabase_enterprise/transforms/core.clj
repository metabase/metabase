  "Enterprise module placeholder for transforms.

  Transforms are weird: they have different behavior on OSS vs EE. We need to test this, so we need tests
  in `enterprise/backend/test/metabase_enterprise/transforms/api_test.clj`.

  But we need a 'real' module, because all tests must belong to a module.

  Hence, this placeholder.")
