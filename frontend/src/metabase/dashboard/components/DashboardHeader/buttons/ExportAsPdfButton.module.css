  /* (metabase#59503) We want to fix this differently (here's the first attempt https://github.com/metabase/metabase/pull/59418).
  So we should just make this work for this particular case for now rather than marking a markup change.

  The reason we need `z-index: 4` here is because the parameter container is defined after this download button in the DOM, and it
  has `z-index: 3`. */
