;; Each query processor function is passed a single arg, QP, and returns a function that accepts a single arg, QUERY.
;;
;; This returned function *pre-processes* QUERY as needed, and then passes it to QP.
;; The function may then *post-process* the results of (QP QUERY) as neeeded, and returns the results.
;;
;; Many functions do both pre and post-processing; this middleware pattern allows them to return closures that maintain some sort of
;; internal state. For example, cumulative-sum can determine if it needs to perform cumulative summing, and, if so, modify the query
;; before passing it to QP, and modify the results of that call.
;;
;; For the sake of clarity, functions are named with the following convention:
;; *  Ones that only do pre-processing are prefixed with pre-
;; *  Ones that only do post-processing are prefixed with post-
;; *  Ones that do both aren't prefixed
;;
;; The <<- (reverse-threading macro) is used below for clarity.
;; Pre-processing happens from top-to-bottom, i.e. the QUERY passed to the function returned by POST-ADD-ROW-COUNT-AND-STATUS is the
;; query as modified by PRE-EXPAND.
;;
;; Pre-processing then happens in order from bottom-to-top; i.e. POST-ANNOTATE gets to modify the results, then LIMIT, then CUMULATIVE-SUM, etc.
