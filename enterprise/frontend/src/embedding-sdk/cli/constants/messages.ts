  Metabase will phone home some anonymous data collected via Snowplow.
  We donâ€™t collect any usernames, emails, server IPs, database details of any kind, or
  any personally identifiable information (PII).

  This anonymous data helps us understand how people are actually using Metabase, which
  in turn helps us prioritize what to work on next.

  so you can see how different tenants experience the dashboard embedded in your app.

  To set up multi-tenancy and SSO with JWT, you'll need a Pro license.

  If you skip this step, the setup will continue without multi-tenancy or SSO.
