  "Param substitution for native queries.

  The Basics:

  *  Things like `{{x}}` (required params) get substituted with the value of `:x`, which can be a literal used in a
     clause (e.g. in a clause like `value = {{x}}`) or a \"field filter\" that handles adding the clause itself
     (e.g. `{{timestamp}}` might become `timestamp BETWEEN ? AND ?`).

  *  Things like `[[AND {{x}]]` are optional params. If the param (`:x`) isn't specified, the *entire* clause inside
     `[[...]]` is replaced with an empty string; If it is specified, the value inside the curly brackets `{{x}}` is
     replaced as usual and the rest of the clause (`AND ...`) is included in the query as-is

  Native parameter parsing and substution logic shared by multiple drivers lives in
  `metabase.driver.common.parameters.*`. Driver-specific parsing/substitution logic is implemented in
  `metabase.driver.sql.parameters.*` (for SQL drivers) or similar namespaces for others.

  The different steps of this process, are similar between existing driver implementations, and are as follows:

  1. `values` parses `:parameters` passed in as arguments to the query and returns a map of param key -> value

  2. `parse` takes a string and breaks it out into a series of string fragments interleaved with objects
     representing optional and non-optional params

  3.  `substitute` (and the related namespace `substitution`) replace optional and param objects with appropriate SQL
      snippets and prepared statement args, and combine the sequence of fragments back into a single SQL string."
