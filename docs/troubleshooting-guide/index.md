## Helpful tidbits

### Accessing the Metabase server logs

You can always look for the logs that Metabase leaves on your server's file system (or wherever else you collect logs). If you're logged into Metabase with an admin account, you can also access the logs from the **Logs** tab in the **Troubleshooting** section of the **Admin Panel**. To get to the Admin Panel, click the **gear icon** in the top-right of Metabase.

### Checking for Javascript console errors

Metabase will send debugging information and errors to your browser's developer console. To open the developer console, follow the instructions for your web browser of choice:
