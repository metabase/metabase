## Working with MySQL in Metabase

### Connecting to MySQL 8+ servers

Metabase uses the MariaDB connector to connect to MariaDB and MySQL servers. Because of this you may experience authentication issues when connecting to MySQL 8+ servers with its updated default authentication plugin.

Please refer to the [troubleshooting guide](../troubleshooting-guide/datawarehouse.md#mysql-unable-to-log-in-to-mysql-8-with-correct-credentials) for more information on how to connect to MySQL 8+ instances.
