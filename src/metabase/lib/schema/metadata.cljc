;;; Column vs Field?
;;;
;;; Lately I've been using `Field` to only mean a something that lives in the application database, i.e. something
;;; that is associated with row in the `Field` table and has an `:id`. I'm using `Column` as a more generic term that
;;; includes not only `Field`s but also the columns returned by a stage of a query, e.g. `SELECT count(*) AS count`
;;; returns a `Column` called `count`, but it's not a `Field` because it's not associated with an actual Field in the
;;; application database.
;;;
;;; Column = any column returned by a query or stage of a query
;;; Field  = a Column that is associated with a capital-F Field in the application database, i.e. has an `:id`
;;;
;;; All Fields are Columns, but not all Columns are Fields.
;;;
;;; Also worth a mention: we also have `Dimension`s, associated with the `dimension` table in the application
;;; database, which can act like psuedo-Fields or affect how we treat normal Fields. For example, Dimensions are used
;;; to implement column remapping, e.g. the GUI might display values of `categories.name` when it presents filter
;;; options for `venues.category_id` -- you can remap a meaningless integer FK column to something more helpful.
;;; 'Human readable values' like these can also be entered manually from the GUI, for example for enum columns. How
;;; will this affect what MLv2 needs to know or does? Not clear at this point, but we'll probably want to abstract
;;; away dealing with Dimensions in the future so the FE QB GUI doesn't need to special case them.
