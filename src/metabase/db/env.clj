(ns metabase.db.env
  "Logic related to fetching and working with the connection details for the application database. These are provided by
  environment variables -- either as a single JDBC connection URL string (`MB_DB_CONNECTION_URI`) or as broken-out
  environment variables e.g. `MB_DB_TYPE`, `MB_DB_HOST`, etc. `MB_DB_CONNECTION_URI` is used preferentially if both
  are specified.

  There are three ways you can specify application JDBC connection information for Metabase:

  1. As broken-out connection details -- see [[env]] for a list of env vars. This is basically the same
    format the actual `:details` map we save when creating a [[metabase.models.Database]] object. We convert this to
    a [[clojure.java.jdbc]] spec map using [[metabase.db.spec/spec]] and then to create a [[javax.sql.DataSource]] from
    it. See [[mdb.data-source/broken-out-details->DataSource]].

  2. As a JDBC connection string specified by `MB_DB_CONNECTION_URI`. This is used to create
     a [[javax.sql.DataSource]]. See [[mdb.data-source/raw-connection-string->DataSource]].

  3. As a JDBC connection string (`MB_DB_CONNECTION_URI`) with username (`MB_DB_USER`) and/or password (`MB_DB_PASS`)
     passed separately. Support for this was added in Metabase 0.43.0 -- see #20122.

  This namespace exposes the vars [[db-type]] and [[data-source]] based on the aforementioned environment variables.
  Normally you should use the equivalent functions in [[metabase.db.connection]] which can be overridden rather than
  using this namespace directly."
