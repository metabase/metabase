;;; The Fields to include in the results *if* a top-level `:fields` clause *is not* specified. This can be either
;;; `:none`, `:all`, or a sequence of Field clauses.
;;;
;;; *  `:none`: no Fields from the joined table or nested query are included (unless indirectly included by
;;;    breakouts or other clauses). This is the default, and what is used for automatically-generated joins.
;;;
;;; *  `:all`: will include all of the Fields from the joined table or query
;;;
;;; *  a sequence of Field clauses: include only the Fields specified. Valid clauses are the same as the top-level
;;;    `:fields` clause. This should be non-empty and all elements should be distinct. The normalizer will
;;;    automatically remove duplicate fields for you, and replace empty clauses with `:none`.
;;;
;;; Driver implementations: you can ignore this clause. Relevant fields will be added to top-level `:fields` clause
;;; with appropriate aliases.
