# Permissions introduction

There are always going to be sensitive bits of information in your data, and thankfully Metabase provides a rich set of tools to ensure that people on your team only see the data theyâ€™re supposed to.

If instead you're wondering about what data Metabase the company can see, check out our page on [data privacy and security](https://www.metabase.com/security).

## Key points regarding permissions

- Permissions are granted to [groups](../people-and-groups/managing.md#groups), not people.
- People can be in more than one group.
- If a person is in multiple groups, they will have the _most permissive_ access granted to them across all of their groups. For example, if a person is in three groups, and any one of those groups has access to a database, then that person will have access to that database.

## What you can set permissions on

- [Data permissions](#data-permissions)
- [Collection permissions](#collection-permissions)
- [Application permissions](#application-permissions)
- [SQL snippet folder permissions](#sql-snippet-folder-permissions)

### Data permissions

- [Databases connected to Metabase](./data.md)
- [Tables and schemas][table-permissions] in those databases
- [Rows and columns][data-sandboxing], a.k.a. data sandboxing (available on paid plans)

### Collection permissions

[Collection permissions][collections] dictate which groups can view/edit items in collections, including:

- Questions
- Dashboards
- Models
- Events
- Timelines

### Application permissions

[Application permissions](application.md) (available on paid plans) dictate access to Metabase application-level features, including:

- **Settings**: The Settings tab in the Admin panel.
- **Monitoring access**: The Tools, Audit, and Troubleshooting tabs in the Admin panel.
- **Subscriptions and Alerts**. Which groups can create/edit dashboard subscriptions and alerts.

### SQL snippet folder permissions

For plans that include [SQL Snippet Folders][sql-snippet-folders], you can also set permissions on those folders.

## Changing permissions

Whenever you change permissions for a group, make sure you:

- Save your changes.
- Click yes to confirm your choices.
