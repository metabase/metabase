;;; ------------------------------------- Deciding which instance is the MetaBot -------------------------------------

;; Close your eyes, and imagine a scenario: someone is running multiple Metabase instances in a horizontal cluster.
;; Good for them, but how do we make sure one, and only one, of those instances, replies to incoming MetaBot commands?
;; It would certainly be too much if someone ran, say, 4 instances, and typing `metabot kanye` into Slack gave them 4
;; Kanye West quotes, wouldn't it?
;;
;; Luckily, we have an "elegant" solution: we'll use the Settings framework to keep track of which instance is
;; currently serving as the MetaBot. We'll have that instance periodically check in; if it doesn't check in for some
;; timeout interval, we'll consider the job of MetaBot up for grabs. Each instance will periodically check if the
;; MetaBot job is open, and, if so, whoever discovers it first will take it.


;; How do we uniquiely identify each instance?
;;
;; `local-process-uuid` is randomly-generated upon launch and used to identify this specific Metabase instance during
;; this specifc run. Restarting the server will change this UUID, and each server in a hortizontal cluster will have
;; its own ID, making this different from the `site-uuid` Setting. The local process UUID is used to differentiate
;; different horizontally clustered MB instances so we can determine which of them will handle MetaBot duties.
;;
;; TODO - if we ever want to use this elsewhere, we need to move it to `metabase.config` or somewhere else central
